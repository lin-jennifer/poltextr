Hello Republicans! I'm Dan Sullivan, from the great state of Alaska.

I'm proud to be standing here tonight with my fellow freshman Senators. This is who we are: Governors and doctors, educators and ministers, CEOs and hog farmers, moms and dads

We have served in the United States Army and the United States Marines.

And now we serve America in the United States Senate. In 2014, YOU made this happen.

Republicans all across the country, coming together, who wanted new energy in the Senate, and who wanted to fire Harry Reid.

And that's EXACTLY what we did.

In 2016, we need to keep that momentum going!

We need to keep the Senate, and win back the White House.

We will put coal miners and oil drillers back to work, not target them for extinction as Hillary promised.

We MUST reignite economic opportunity and the American dream for  everybody.

And TOGETHER we WILL make America great again
