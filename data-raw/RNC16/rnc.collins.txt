From the moment the first Pilgrims arrived on our shores, Americans have been asking, "what's next?" We are a nation built by the passion of people who weren't afraid to do something first, to step into the unknown, and pave our own way forward. We are a nation of explorers. 

In 1961, President Kennedy issued a challenge to America: to land a man on the moon and return him safely to Earth. 47 years ago on this very day, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin answered that call and walked on the moon. They took with them an American flag and a plaque bearing the inscription: "here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon July 1969. We came in peace for all mankind." 

We landed on the moon to fulfill a leadership challenge and to explore. Exploration leads to innovation and discovery. Our successful robotic missions to Mars, Jupiter, and Pluto have provided valuable new information about our own planet. 

But in 2011, the space shuttle program ended. The last time the US launched our own astronauts from our own soil was over 5 years ago. We must do better than that! 

Countries that are strong explore, invent, and discover to remain resilient in a changing world. I am honored to have played a role in our nation's heritage of explorers as the first woman to command a space shuttle mission, joining the ranks of those that have fought to lead the way. 

We are all so proud of our Apollo program that put our astronauts on the Moon: first, in peace, for all mankind. Nations that lead on the frontier, lead in the world. We need that visionary leadership again. Leadership that will inspire the next generation to have that same passion. 

We need leadership that will challenge every American to ask, "What's next?" We need leadership that will make America's space program first again. We need leadership that will make America first again. That leader is Donald Trump. 

Thank you and God bless the United States of America!
