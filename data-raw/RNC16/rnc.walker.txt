"My fellow Americans, you have a choice. You deserve better. America deserves better. The well-connected in Washington are lining up behind Hillary Clinton, because she is one of them.

They want more of the same.


Donald Trump is standing with the American people. We want a leader who is not afraid to take on the mess in Washington. We believe that there is a better way forward. As Republicans, we believe in an America where everyone can get the education and training that they need to succeed in college, career, and life; one where Washington doesn’t deepen dependency, but rather helps create genuine opportunity.

Why? Because America deserves better.

We believe in a country where people can achieve, maintain, and enjoy their piece of the American Dream – without the government standing in the way.

Why? Because America deserves better.

We believe in a country where we take the threat of terrorism seriously. We name it for what it is: Radical…. Islamic…. Terrorism. And we do everything in our power to eliminate it - to ensure our safety.

Why? Because America deserves better.

We believe in a country where it is a solemn responsibility to deliver to our troops the support and tools they need to achieve victory and then provide them with the health care and respect they've earned when they return home.

Why? Because America deserves better.

And while we're at it, we believe in a country where those who honorably serve in law enforcement - the people who put their lives on the line for us - are not just respected – they are revered.

Why? Because America deserves better.

We believe in a country where power is taken back from Washington and returned home to state and local governments - where it is more effective, more efficient and more accountable to the people.

Why? Because America deserves better.

We believe in a country where freedom and personal success do not come from the clumsy hand of government, but rather the dignity that comes from hard work.

Why? Because America deserves better.

The simple truth is: liberal Washington insiders CREATED these problems. And Hillary Clinton is the ULTIMATE liberal Washington insider. If she were any more on the “inside,” she’d be in prison.

America deserves better than Hillary Clinton.

THAT, is why we need to support Donald Trump and Mike Pence for President and Vice President.

Last August, I said that any of the Republicans running would be better than Hillary Clinton. I meant it then, and I mean it now. So let me be clear: a vote for anyone other than Donald Trump in November is a vote for Hillary Clinton.

Make no mistake: we can’t wait four more years and “get ‘em next time.” The consequences are too great. After hearing the FBI Director's recent comments, I wouldn't even give Hillary Clinton the password to my iPhone - let alone access to classified information.

This isn't just another Clinton scandal, Hillary's scandal put our national security at risk and that makes her unfit to be President. It’s time to tell Hillary: enough is enough. No more double standards for the Clintons.

Why? Because America deserves better.

Thankfully, Republicans are offering a better way forward. It's working right here in Ohio...and in Florida, New Mexico, North Carolina and South Carolina. And even in Massachusetts and Maryland. Republican leadership works. I see it first hand as it's working in Wisconsin.

In 2010, we were tired of high unemployment, budget deficits, stifling taxes, and rising college tuition.

Most of all, we were tired of the big government union bosses running our state and local governments. We had enough. So we did something about it.

We took back power from the big government special interests and returned it firmly into the hands of the hard-working taxpayers. In turn, the big government special interests - and their cronies in Washington - helped organize more than 100,000 protestors who occupied our state Capitol. They tried to intimidate us with threats and mobs, but we didn't back down.

And we won.

Then, they spent tens of millions of dollars to try and defeat us in a recall election, but we didn't back down. And we won. THREE times they came at us. THREE times we won.

We won because our common sense reforms worked. Today, more people are employed in Wisconsin than ever before, our budget is balanced and responsible, taxes are down for working families and seniors; and college tuition is frozen for four years in a row. If conservative reforms can work in a blue state like mine, they can work anywhere in the country. You see, it wasn't too late for Wisconsin … and it's not too late for America.

If you've had enough of Washington’s brokenness, wastefulness, empty promises and arrogance, join us. Help us elect Republicans to office - from the courthouse to the statehouse to the White House.

You have a choice. You decide. You deserve better.

Because America deserves better.
