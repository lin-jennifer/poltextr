Like generations of Americans, I've always dreamed about making that proud walk across a graduation stage to get my college diploma.

In 2005, that dream came true at Grand Valley State University, which prepared me to do what I love – teach back home in North Carolina.

Then came the bill. $40,000 in student debt, and all the anxiety and struggle that comes with it.

Teaching offers so many rewards. A big salary isn't one of them.

The $300 check I write every month represents savings I can't put away, car repairs I can't make, medical costs I have to put off. 

And with my wife, Amanda, in school after taking time off to help care for her sick mother, another $30,000 bill is on the way.

Life feels like we're running on a treadmill. No matter how hard we try, we can't get ahead.

I'm not alone. Student debt has more than doubled in the last decade and now exceeds $1.2 trillion.

None of us are looking for guaranteed success – just a fair chance at it. That's why I'm so proud to support Hillary Clinton.

She's going to make college debt-free for all and help millions of people like me, with existing debt, save thousands of dollars.

I don't know her. But, it feels like she knows me.

Hillary Clinton has our backs.

Let's have hers in November.
