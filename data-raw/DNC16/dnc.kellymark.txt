Thank you, everyone. I speak to you tonight as the proud son of two New Jersey cops; as a veteran of 39 combat missions during Operation Desert Storm and of 25 years in the United States Navy. And as a former NASA astronaut who flew four missions to space.

My decades as a pilot, military officer, and astronaut gave me a unique perspective. From above, I saw our country at its best. I also saw humanity at its worst. I saw us lead an international coalition against the illegal invasion of Kuwait. I also saw the devastating human effects of war itself.

From orbit, I saw our planet as a perfect blue marble. But I also saw shrinking glaciers and rainforests. At war and in space, I saw American leadership on display. But I was always frustrated to return to a country that struggles to address some of our biggest problems here at home.

Just as Hillary is prepared to defend America, our values, and our freedom, Hillary is ready to take on one of our country's greatest moral failures here on our soil: the gun violence that is tearing so many of our communities apart.

We have to do better — and Hillary knows we can. Hillary knows that we save lives by doing more to keep guns out of the wrong hands. We know that as President she'll do the responsible thing: She'll stand up to the Washington gun lobby that works to protect the shameful status quo.

So if you want our legacy to be that we left our kids and grandkids a country with less gun violence — not more — then we need to make Hillary our President!

Now, I want to introduce you to someone who is working every day to do just that. Someone who has taught me to deny the acceptance of failure. And someone who believes, like Hillary does, that we are all Stronger Together.

My wife.

Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords.
