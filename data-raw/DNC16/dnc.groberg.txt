 I'm here tonight not as a Democrat or a Republican.

I'm here as a proud immigrant to this country, a proud veteran of the United States Army, and the proud recipient of our country's highest military honor.

Soldiers spend years training for one moment. We don't know when it will come. We don't know what it will require. But we know that when it arrives, we'll be ready.

My moment came four years ago in Afghanistan.

A suicide bomber approached my men. I grabbed him by the vest. I threw him as far as I could – because that's exactly what I was trained to do.

The vest exploded. It took a part of my leg with it.

I was a runner in college. But the run to that vest was the last run of my life.

America lost four heroes that day: Army Command Sgt. Air Force Maj. Kevin Griffin, Army Maj. Walter David Gray, Maj. Thomas Kennedy, and USAID Foreign Service Officer Ragaei Abdelfattah.

I remind you, in their memory, that your military protects you with their lives. Our President should protect us in return.

Hillary Clinton has been training for this moment for decades.

In the Senate, she worked across the aisle to support wounded warriors and our families.

As President, she'll reform the VA – not privatize it. She'll help heal the invisible wounds that lead to suicide. And as Commander-in-Chief, she will defeat ISIS.

When Hillary's moment comes, she'll be ready.

Ready to serve. Ready to lead. And ready to defend those who defend you.
