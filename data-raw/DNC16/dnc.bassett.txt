They were gathered to pray.

He walked in. An outsider, a stranger. And they welcomed him.

But then, he opened fire. He stole their lives.

We say their names. But that's not enough, is it?

Since the massacre at Charleston's Emanuel AME Church, more lives have been destroyed by gun violence, and hatred still threatens to tear us apart.

After Charleston, Hillary Clinton challenged all of us to turn our grief into action.

We have to do that.

Still, there are days when it feels like our bodies and minds are under too much pressure. Then I remember we have souls, too. And I thank God our souls are on fire!

I visited Charleston this year, and I can tell you that the city's soul is on fire. That soul burns with resilience. It fuels their resistance. It brought down the Confederate flag, and it brings the Charleston community closer together every day.

We are honored to have Charleston survivors Felecia Sanders and Polly Sheppard here with us tonight. Please join me in welcoming them.
