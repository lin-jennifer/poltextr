Me yah whae!  

I'm a Native American and Chairman of my tribe, the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians.

Like tribes across the United States, we have faced hardship and discrimination. Our ancestors fought to preserve our tribes and our culture, just as I do today.

Hillary Clinton is the leader that all of Indian Country needs. She is the leader for our America.

Ah Cha Ma.
