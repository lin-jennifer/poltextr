Long before she ever held elected office, Hillary Clinton fought for kids every way she could. So you know she continued that fight once she got to the Senate.

I spent my childhood in the New York foster care system, moving from home to home with a trash bag as my suitcase. But if you're a kid in the system who never finds a permanent home, when you turn 18, you're on your own. After my high school graduation, my social worker shook my hand and wished me luck. That was it.

But Hillary had this crazy notion: Every kid deserves to live up to their God-given potential. So she reserved an internship spot in her Senate office just for former foster youth. In 2003, I got that spot. I remember our first meeting vividly. She looked me in the eye and said "Jelani, I'm proud of you." I felt seen and heard — for the first time in my life.

Throughout the years, Hillary has remained a source of encouragement. She has made me more mindful of my responsibility and purpose. Hillary taught me that there is a high cost for low expectations — and that you receive a blessing to become a blessing.

She inspired me to become a lawyer and an advocate for children in my community. Love dignifies us; it elevates us to higher plateaus. Hillary's love did that for me. It lifted me to a place I never had the courage to imagine.

That's why I'm with Her.
