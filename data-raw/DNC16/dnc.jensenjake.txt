Jake: I was so happy after I got hired last month at Pizza Studio that I immediately shared the news on SnapChat. My friend Jensen messaged me and told me she got hired there, too. We were excited that we'd be working together. Then we started talking and figured out that I would be making $8.25 an hour, but Jensen was only offered $8. We are the same age. We were hired for the same job on the same day. And as far as we could tell, we both had the same knowledge of pizza. So we didn't understand why we wouldn't be paid the same amount.

Jensen: I thought it was a mistake, so I called our new boss to ask. Instead of fixing it, she fired me and Jake for talking about our wages. And she never answered my question about why I was going to be paid less. Then our story started getting out. We couldn't believe it when Hillary Clinton tweeted her support for me and shared our story. I may have lost my job, but I'm proud that I spoke up for myself, and I'm glad that Jake stood with me. And we're both glad that Hillary Clinton stood with us.

Jake: Our story isn't just about fighting for equal pay. It's about doing the right thing and having each other's back. Because if we don't do that, nothing will change.

Jensen: It doesn't matter how old you are. We all need to be brave enough to speak up for ourselves and stand up for each other. That's what this country is all about. We are stronger when we Stand Together.
