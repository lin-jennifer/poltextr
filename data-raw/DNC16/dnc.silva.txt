When I was four years old, my mother and I climbed into a raft, and we crossed a river to join my father in America in search of a better life. All I had was a little doll.

I grew up like an ordinary girl: my dad worked as a landscaper, and my mom stayed at home with my brother and I. But while my friends did ordinary things, I couldn't, because my parents were afraid that someone might discover I was undocumented.

My family believed so deeply in the promise of this country that we risked everything for the American Dream. As an undocumented student, I felt like college was out of reach. But after a journey of ten years, I finally graduated from Nevada State College.

My family and I are here because of people like Senator Harry Reid; mi abuelito, who put themselves in our shoes and helped us; and while President Obama's immigration action protected me, we live in constant fear that my parents could be taken away from their grandson, Noah.

So when Donald Trump talks about deporting eleven million people, he's talking about ripping families apart. Separating families like mine, and like Carla's. Hillary Clinton understands that this is not who we are as as country. I have seen her comfort children like Carla, who are scared that they might lose their parents to deportation.

I know she will fight to keep our families together. Nuestras familias. I know she will.

Thank you.
