Hillary Clinton has spoken of watching Nelson Mandela embrace his former jailers because he didn't want to be imprisoned twice, once by steel and concrete, once by anger and bitterness.

I've worked for years with the Innocence Project - the extraordinary organization that fights to exonerate the wrongfully convicted. I've never heard a single exoneree - many of whom have spent decades in prison for crimes they didn't commit - speak of anger or outrage, only of their desire to reform the system so others might be spared their suffering.

I am proud to introduce a group of women profoundly impacted by injustice and violence who have turned their pain into power and their outrage into action. They are the Mothers of the Movement. They understand that we must reach out to each other because of our diversity. Because we are stronger together.

Hillary says, "We can't hide from these hard truths about race and justice in America. We have to name them and own them and then change them." That's what she'll do as president.

And the Mothers of the Movement prove that one life at a time, one mother at a time, we can change the world.
