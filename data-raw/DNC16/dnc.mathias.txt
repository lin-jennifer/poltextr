 Four months ago, Hillary Clinton sat with me in a doughnut shop in Marion, Ohio, and she asked to hear my story.

I told her that my husband and I work three jobs just to make ends meet. Between us, we work for 24 hours a day. We only see each other when we pass each other in the doorway — when one of us is coming home, and the other is leaving.

And I only see my kids when they're in bed. I get home too late to spend any quality time with them. Our life is consumed by work, but we're still crushed by debt: medical, student loans. We have no savings.

We work hard, and yet it feels like the world is against us. But I told Hillary Clinton that even though every day is a struggle, we don't want a handout.

We want a hand to help us up.

And she understood, because she believes that America is strongest when we look out for one another; when no one who works full time has to choose between making a car payment and feeding their children.

That's why I'm here — taking time off from both of my jobs — to ask you to put in the time to elect Hillary Clinton, and help make life better for me and millions of people just like me.

I believe we can do it.

And I believe in Hillary Clinton.

Thank you.
