In 1972, Hillary traveled to Alabama on a mission. She was there to help shed light on segregated academies â€” private schools that cropped up across the state after the Supreme Court ordered public schools to integrate. When these schools applied for federal tax exemptions, they claimed they weren't trying to promote segregation, but Hillary helped prove they were. Hillary visited one of these academies posing as a mother looking to enroll her child. And, sure enough, the administrators assured her they didn't accept black children. Hillary shared her findings with the Children's Defense Fund.

As the founder of a Philadelphia nonprofit focused on education and community, I wake up every morning thinking about how to give more African American young people the chance to live the future they deserve. I know Hillary Clinton wakes up thinking about the same thing. That's why I'm with Her.
