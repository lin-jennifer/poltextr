I'm here because the next president of these United States invited me. At first I wondered if Hillary really knew who I was. Not just my work in entertainment, but who I really am? Does she know my sister's under house arrest? Does she know my brother, Maynard, is in jail? That my father was a police officer, shot and murdered right here in Philadelphia, when I was 15? Does she even know I've been to jail?

That's the America that I know. And still I rise. And then it hit me like a brick. Hillary knows me. And that's what gave me the courage to speak to you tonight.

Hillary has stood with families of people who died due to gun violence. She's helped turn their heartache into action. I wish there was a Hillary around for me when I lost my dad. Hillary understands our right to bear arms but wants to keep guns from getting into the wrong hands.

Thirty-three thousand Americans die each year from gun violence. That's 90 people a day. Enough. We need to take action now. And there is only one candidate willing to take on the gun lobby and keep our families safe.

And for that millennial who comes from where I come from and doesn't think they have a voice â€” you do. There is no other choice. This is the most important election of our lifetime. Come November, vote for her.

And may God bless you, Hillary Clinton, and please, God, bless America.
