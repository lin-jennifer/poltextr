 I'm here tonight because of my passionate commitment to our amazing democracy, as an American deeply concerned about my family's future, indeed, our nation's shared future. And, I'm particularly concerned about the climate crisis.

You see, when we talk about greenhouse gases and warming temperatures, deadlier droughts, and more devastating storms, we're not talking just about the weather, but how the weather affects the economy and, thus, our people. They're the people you'll see in a few moments, people affected by climate change right here in America, right now. They are us.

A rancher in Texas losing his herd because the cows have no grass to eat. A farmer in Kansas whose crops are dying because there's no rain. A mom in New York who lost her young daughter in a flood made worse by rising sea levels.

Can Donald Trump look these people in the eye and say climate change is, "a hoax?" That there's nothing we can do? This is a moment when we, as a nation, have to decide whether we'll ignore the truth and allow real people to continue to suffer, or whether we will put aside our differences, and come together to do what's right.

Hillary Clinton gets it. She cares. She's committed. She understands that taking a stand against climate change is not about politics. It's about our moral obligation to one another, to our children, and to the generations that will one day inherit this earth.
