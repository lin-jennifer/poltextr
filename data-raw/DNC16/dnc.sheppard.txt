Amen.

To heal, we must forgive.

That's what I've learned this past year.

The shooter in Charleston had hate in his heart. The shooter in Orlando had hate in his heart. And the shooter in Dallas did too.

So much hate. Too much. But, as Scripture says, "Love never fails."

So, I choose love. And, in this election, I choose Hillary Clinton.

Hillary was in South Carolina the day before the shooting. And in the days that followed, she talked about the hatred in our nation, the racism, the injustice. She said that we can't hide from these truths. She called on us to "name them and own them and then change them."

Together, we can fight for that change. Together, we can heal. Together, we can love.

Thank you.
