Dear God,

We are a nation that needs healing. Break down the barriers of race and ethnicity that separate us.

Cure the sexism and homophobia that deny the dignity of so many of our fellow Americans.

Show us how to love the needy in our midstâ€“and even our enemies. Help us overcome evil with good.

Imbue our religious leaders with Your love so that they will teach us how to transcend our differences and become one people.

Teach us how to beat our swords into plowshares and learn war no more.

We pray that the next president of our country will sense the obligation to reach out with our vast resources to minister to those whom You called, "the least of these," not only here in America, but to people in need around the world.

May all of our political leaders be committed to making America into a people that strive to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, provide care for all the sick, speak justice on behalf of the oppressed, and make room for refugees, remembering Your own Son who was once a refugee in the land of Egypt.

On this memorable night, we pray for Hillary Clinton. May her candidacy send a message to women everywhere that the glass ceiling that has held so many of them down is being broken, and that a new day is dawning, not only for women, but for all people everywhere.

We ask all these things in Your holy name.

Amen.
