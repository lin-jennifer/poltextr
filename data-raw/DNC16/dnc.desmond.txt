In her early 20s, Hillary Clinton spent time at the Yale New Haven Hospital researching child abuse. She saw children who had been beaten, burned, and neglected. The experience turned her into a lifelong champion for kids in need. I know from my own life how important that work is.

My decision to become a child advocate social worker was influenced by my own social worker. She was so committed to my future that she not only advocated for me â€” she adopted me. Today, I proudly call her Mom. Every kid deserves an advocate who truly cares for them, and they have one in Hillary Clinton. Hillary knows that when you fight for our kids, you're fighting for our future. That's why I'm with Her.
