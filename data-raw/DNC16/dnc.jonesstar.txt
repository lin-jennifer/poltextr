"I will fight for you," she said, "no matter how long it takes." I have known Hillary Rodham Clinton for over two decades now.

And years ago, when she visited us on "The View," I told her, "When you decide that you're ready to be the first woman President of the United States, I'll be there to help."

So, here I am! But most importantly, here we all are. And we are all with her, because she has always been with us!

As a former prosecutor, I like to deal in facts. Here's a fact: "There has never been any man or woman more qualified for this office than Hillary, ever."

President Barack Obama said that.

Here's another fact: Nobody else in the race has the same unique connection to women, children, families, and our day-to-day challenges.

I'm saying that.

And that's very different from some very loud, obnoxious, race-baiting folk on the other side, who I also knowâ€¦

Shade.

Boy, bye.

Nowhere do we need a president who cares about all Americans more than in the place we're about to visit: Flint, Michigan.
