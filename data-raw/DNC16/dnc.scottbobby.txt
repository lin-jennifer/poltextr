My fellow Democrats, I met Tim Kaine during his first campaign for Richmond City Council.

I saw in him what I still see in him now: a person of substance, passion, principle, and integrity. A great convener, who brings people together.

Even as he's risen from city hall to the governor's mansion to the U.S. Capitol, I still see in Tim the same sense of purpose – the fundamental goodness – that led him to become a civil rights lawyer: listening to his neighbors' concerns and fears, fighting for the underserved and unrepresented, and finding solutions to make his community better and more fair.

The Bible calls on us to act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly. There are few people who live that creed as fully and as completely as Tim Kaine.

So it's my great honor to place into nomination for the Office of Vice President of the United States of America, my friend, the gentleman from Virginia, Tim Kaine!

Madam Chair, I move to suspend the rules and nominate by acclamation Tim Kaine as the Democratic Party's vice presidential candidate.
