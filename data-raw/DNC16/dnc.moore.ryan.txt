My name is Ryan Moore.

My family began our friendship with Hillary over 20 years ago.

Back then, she was First Lady, fighting for health care reform. As a person with a rare form of dwarfism, my family knew that my life was going to be filled with surgeries and hospital visits. So we were grateful when Hillary asked to hear our story. For me, quality, affordable health care was more than a privilege, and even more than a right. It was an absolute necessity.

I'm thankful that she's kept up the fight over the years. And I'm honored to call her my friend.

Here's what I can tell you from my years knowing Hillary Clinton.

She's compassionate. Every time I see Hillary, she remembers meaningful details about my life, sometimes from years earlier. When I first met her, I was 7 years old and wearing a back brace. Two years later, when I saw her again, she patted my back and said, "You don't have a back brace anymore!" I couldn't believe that she remembered that. A lot of people wouldn't have – but she did.

She's thoughtful. Every time I have a big operation coming up, I always receive a note from Hillary, full of encouragement and kindness. She lifts my spirits. She helps me believe that everything is going to be all right.

Most of all, she's genuine. Something happens when you meet Hillary. No matter how busy she is — and I'm pretty sure she's always really busy — she makes you feel like the most important person in her day. She blocks everything else out and just focuses on me — how school's going, how I'm feeling. She really cares.

And I know that so many people who've met her over the years say the exact same thing.

I wish everyone could get to know Hillary's heart like I have. She always looks out for the "little guy" - no pun intended.

And that's why I'm so proud to support Hillary Clinton as our next president.
