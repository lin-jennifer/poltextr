Hillary began working on adoption and foster care issues as a law student — and never stopped. As First Lady, she advocated for landmark legislation to make it easier for families to adopt kids in need — especially older kids who worried they'd never find a permanent home.

My 17-year-old son Heath was once one of those kids. We adopted Heath four years ago — but it feels like he's been part of the family forever. My three other kids swear Heath was on family vacations we took years before he joined the family.

I'm not a Democrat. But Hillary cares about kids like Heath, and about making families like mine complete. That's why I'm with Her.
