My name is Henrietta Ivey. I am a Detroit home care worker, a mother of four and proud grandmother of seven. I am blessed to do work I truly believe in: keeping families in their homes and caring for people in need. But even as I work my fingers to the bone, I don't always feel the support I need from the leaders I'm supposed to trust. I work two jobs at minimum wage and can barely make ends meet.

I remember looking at my babies' faces when they were little, and fighting back tears. Because I always taught them to dream big, but I didn't always know if they would live those dreams.

When I first met Hillary Clinton, we connected right away as mothers and as people who have led lives of service. That is why I stand with Hillary. Because I know she will fight to raise the minimum wage. In Michigan, we are "Fighting for 15!" A $15 minimum wage! Because NO working family should be forced to live in poverty!

I see myself in Hillary, and I know she sees herself in me. That makes this election bigger than politics.

For my family, this is personal. That's why I'm with Hillary. Because I know she's with me!

Thank you, and God bless you all.
