As the first lady of Arkansas, Hillary Clinton chaired the state's Educational Standards Commission. She put the schools she visited to what she called the Chelsea Test. If it wasn't good enough for her daughter, it wasn't good enough for any child.

She played a major role in shaping the state's education policy and improving standards at schools like the one I went to. When she started, Arkansas' schools were ranked second worst in the nation. By the time she was done, they were among the most improved.

Now, as a teacher in those same public schools, I know my students continue to benefit from the work Hillary started all those years ago. That's why I'm with Her.
