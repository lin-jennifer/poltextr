Before I was a comic book creator, or "Cousin Pam" or "Maxine Shaw" on TV, I was just a girl from Philly by way of Arizona.

My mother was a teacher. My father was a preacher. They worked multiple jobs to feed their six kids. We were the working poor. Still, we had our eyes on a future where we were just like folks on TV. More "Jeffersons" than "Good Times." Ya' feel me?

My family's struggle is familiar to millions of American families today. No one will fight harder for these families, for us all, than Hillary Clinton.

I've seen Hillary at work for nearly a decade. I've witnessed a kindness and grace that endures, even when you know she must be "almost-a-million" miles tired and longing for home. It is an uncommon grace and strength. It seems to defy gravity.

Hillary defies gravity. And as president, she will inspire us all to rise.

You're about to meet a young man named Ryan Moore, who has felt that inspiration. His friendship with Hillary was forged 23 years ago by their shared commitment to health care, and their willingness to keep fighting for change, striving for progress, and defying gravity. 

Please welcome Ryan Moore.
