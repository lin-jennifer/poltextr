At the age of 24, I deployed to Iraq. We regularly received indirect fire. After an attack, everything would fall silent. Seconds later, I would hear the sounds of the Army artillery battery returning fire, and the quick reaction force helicopters taking off in the enemy's direction.

As a young Marine Corps lieutenant in a non-combat position, these two units, along with the special operations teams and Marine infantry battalions stationed with us, were our first line of defense.

I trusted them with my life.

I trusted that my commanders had the right strategy.

I trusted that we were abiding by the rules of engagement—even when our enemy chose not to.

That trust starts at the top of the chain of command.

And I trust Hillary Clinton to be Commander-in-Chief. She understands the importance of a strong military and diplomacy. She knows we're stronger when we work with our allies to keep us safe, and she has a specific plan to defeat and destroy ISIS. She has the experience, temperament, and steady hand to lead.

I don't trust Donald Trump.

The military is defined by discipline. Leadership. Integrity. Those are the qualities that drew me to serve. And those are the very qualities that Donald Trump lacks.

He suggests abandoning our closest allies. He praises dictators who've killed Americans. He says we should allow more countries to get nuclear weapons.

His recklessness means more deployments for my friends, more families separated, and more young heroes never coming home.

When he says he would expand torture, kill civilians, or force the military to commit war crimes, he's defying the values that every service member is taught. He's defying the values we risk our lives to defend.

This election isn't just about Donald Trump's judgment—it's about ours. Our troops, our nation, our world can't afford for us to get this wrong.
