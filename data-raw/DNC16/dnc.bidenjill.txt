Thank you. It's great to be back in Philly.

Once again, we're making history. Together, we will elect the first woman President of the United States, Hillary Rodham Clinton.

Let me start by thanking you for allowing me to serve as Second Lady of the United States for the past eight years. It has been an honor.

And let me thank you for the love and support you have given our family. It has meant the world to us.

Over the past eight years, America has gotten to know the Joe Biden that I know and love.

He's honest and strong; principled and compassionate.

He was authentic long before it became a buzzword in politics.

He understands that working people are the backbone of this nation.

And he has tremendous empathy for those in need.

He knows – as I do – that education is the great equalizer and that community colleges are America's best-kept secret.

And he believes – as do I – that we have a special obligation to our military and their families.

He has a deep commitment to justice and he has spent his whole career standing up to the abuse of power.

He knows, at its best, politics is always a matter of the heart.

And he remains today – even after all he's been through – the most optimistic person I know.

He loves his family. And he loves this country.

He's your Vice President and my husband, Joe Biden.
