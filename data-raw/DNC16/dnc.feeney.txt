 Good afternoon, fellow Democrats!

I am a proud member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 2222 in Boston, Mass.

Can I call you my brothers and sisters?

In that case, my brothers and sisters, we are at a crossroads.

In just a matter of moments, we will enter a new phase in our party and chart a new course for the future of our country.

As we turn the page, we must be reflective of this past year, when working people across our country joined with Sen. Bernie Sanders to reignite a political revolution in the United States of America.

Bernie not only fought for people. He empowered people.

To my brothers and sisters that have been a part of this historic campaign, I urge you to stay engaged. Stay active. Stay fired up, because we have shown this country that people-powered politics can never be defeated.

They say that movements are made up of a series of moments.

My brothers and sisters, it's moments like the one we find ourselves in right now, here in Philadelphia, as we stand on the verge of nominating our candidate for President.

It's moments like the one we had last night, when Bernie signs filled this hall and were held up not only by Bernie supporters but by Hillary supporters as well.

We should be proud to not only share this moment together but to build this movement together.

Bernie's campaign came together around a shared set of values and ideals. Values and ideals that are central tenets of who we are as a party.

But all of those things are nothing more than words on paper unless we decide, as Bernie asked us to last night, to join together and support Hillary Clinton.

My brothers and sisters, my fellow Democrats, now is the time.

Now is the time to send a message to the rest of America that our party is united.

Our movement is alive.

And our revolution has just begun.

With that, I proudly rise to second the nomination of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont as the Democratic nominee for President of the United States.
