Almighty God, we come to You tonight because we recognize our desperate need of You. Each of us, Democrats, Republicans, and Independents, knows that we depend on You and that You love us all. As we walk into the autumn of elections we pray You would guide our great nation.

Lord, help us transcend the nefarious traps of cynicism, despair, and division with the courageous work of hope and love. Teach us to continuously cherish and fervently defend the dignity of all our sisters and brothers. Help us never to tire in the work of compassion and justice. Instruct us to be ever-mindful of the most vulnerable among us; the child, the widow, the orphan, and the immigrant. Dios, danos la valentia de confrontar nuestros desaf√≠os con amor. Help us to hew the future of our Republic from the bedrock of love. May our work reflect Your character of compassion, justice, and civility. May we never be satisfied until every child of God has an opportunity to flourish.

From Portland to Philadelphia, from our small towns to our magnificent cities, from our police officers to our children, help us to move forward in unity; a more perfect union that believes that despair and violence can never triumph over love, hope, and justice. Lord, help us to do this work together - rich and poor, from every ethnicity and color, women and men, the elderly and the young. We confess that we are our brother's and sister's keeper and that together we can do more. Give us optimistic tenacity to respond to some of the day's persistent chasms with hope. Help us to never cease until our nation sees the day when we transform any jangling discords in our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood and sisterhood.

This I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
