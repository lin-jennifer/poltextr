Good evening, my name is Lorella Praeli, and I am an American. As you saw in the video, I recently became a U.S. Citizen, but for 14 years I was undocumented. At the age of 2, I was hit by a car and lost my leg. When I think about our American story, I believe it was born in the hearts of my parents that night as they stood over my hospital bed.

Because my parents were determined that I would reach my full potential and not be limited by my disability. And eventually, the only place that could contain such a vision was here in America. Because this is a country that was made for people with the courage to believe in their dreams.

Back in Peru, my mother, Chela, was a psychologist. But here in America, she's worked cleaning houses for the last 17 years, from morning to night, carrying the American spirit in her heart. She, like so many millions of parents across this country, worked so that my sister and I could have a full life. She has taught me to never give up, to believe in my dreams, and to fight to achieve them. In short, it was my undocumented mother that taught me what it is to be an American.

That's why I'm fighting for Hillary Clinton. Because she never gives up. Because she believes in our dreams, and because she will fight to achieve them.

Entonces, amigos, nuestra voz está en nuestro voto. Así que, si queremos hacer historia este noviembre, si queremos que nos oigan, tomen sus teléfonos ahora mismo y texteen DREAM, D – R – E – A - M al 47246. Y asegúrense de que nadie se quede en casa el diá de la elección. 

So let's go out. Knock on doors, talk to our friends and family, register new voters, make sure that no one stays home! And together, make history this November.

Juntos se puede. Thank you, and God bless the United States of America.
