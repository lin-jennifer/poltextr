I will never forget the moment I heard that Patrick's helicopter did not return. In an instant, the life I knew was destroyed. The partner I loved, gone. My daughter's father, taken away, forever.

I've never felt more scared or alone than I did then. I wondered what Christmas and birthdays would look like. But half a country away, a United States Senator was looking out for me — and countless others like me. Her name was Hillary Clinton. You see, before Hillary took office, the families of fallen soldiers received $12,000. And yet, when you need to bury your best friend, when you need to raise a child on your own, when you need to rebuild your life from rubble, $12,000 doesn't go very far.

Hillary understood, so she did something about it. Without fuss or fanfare, she worked across party lines. She led the Congress to increase survivor benefits to $100,000. And it made all the difference in the world.

Looking back on it, I didn't even realize who was responsible. And when I did learn about Hillary's work, I didn't see her as a Democrat or a Republican. I simply saw a fighter for people like us, for families like mine. She stood up for the principle that a family's personal tragedy must not be a financial tragedy as well.

Today, my daughter Brisa is finishing high school. I'm completing my degree in emergency crisis management, committed to serving my country in the best way that I can. And our family is making it — step by step, day by day.

Hillary Clinton has fought for families like mine, each and every day of her career. This is a woman who I have never met — whose life could not be more different from my own — but who has stood with my family and me, over and over again.

Hillary has always been with me — in bad times and in worse. And that's why I'm with Her.
