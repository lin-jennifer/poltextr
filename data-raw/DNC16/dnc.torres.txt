Great Spirit, we seek your blessing and guidance on this convention and the wonderfully diverse group of people gathered here from across this great nation of ours. Help us to be mindful of the importance of this endeavor to the country and to the democracy we are so privileged to live under.

Please, help us to appreciate our diversity, to respect differences in our cultures, traditions, beliefs, and to show tolerance and understanding of others, as we grapple with the critical issues facing our country. Give us the strength to put aside our differences, and unite in the face of challenges and adversity.

Help us to make this country, and the world, a more just, safer, and healthier place for all humankind. Teach us to respect Mother Earth, recognizing the wonderful way that she can provide for us when we do so. Help us to be mindful of, and generous towards, those who are less fortunate than us.

Guide and protect our leaders, both those gathered here today and those who are not, and encourage them to act wisely and unselfishly.

Thank you for all you have given us, and particularly for the extraordinarily bounteous and beautiful country we share.

Amen.
