I wasn't born in America, but every day, I serve it.

As a Colonel in the Air Force Reserves, a Member of Congress, and an immigrant whose parents chose this country, I care deeply about who serves as our Commander-in-Chief.

I look forward to January 20, when that woman is Hillary Clinton.

But you don't have to serve in Congress or wear a uniform to insist that the person we entrust with the security of our country, the lives of our troops, and our nuclear launch codes has a steady hand.

All you have to do is be a voter.

The scariest part of Donald Trump's acceptance speech wasn't the apocalyptic America he says he sees.

It's that he said, "I alone can fix it."

Every commander I've met in the military knows that they can't do it alone, or be brash, or make stuff up.

Because when you ignore facts, people will die.

Hillary Clinton knows that each of us and all of our elements of national power make us strong:

Smart diplomacy. A powerful economy. Educated children.

We are Stronger Together.

Donald Trump said – and I am not making this up – "I know more about ISIS than the generals do."

Please welcome the general who knows more about ISIS than anyone, the President's former Special Envoy to the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL, retired Marine Gen. John Allen.
