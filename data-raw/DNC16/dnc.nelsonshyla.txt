 My friends, my name is Shyla Nelson. I come from the great state of Vermont, and I have never "Felt the Bern" more than I do at this moment.

Together we have worked to take our country back from the millionaires and the billionaires. Together we have worked to end Citizens United and restore democracy to the people. Together we have worked for a $15 minimum wage, for debt-free college, for breaking up the big banks, for climate justice, and for the man who launched this revolution, Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Tonight, my friends, we celebrate the progress we have made in this campaign, and set a course for the progress we will make when we win in November.

I am so proud of all of us. I am so proud of all of you, my friends: the millions who have volunteered, the millions who have donated, the millions who have stood at rallies across this great land and demanded change.

And I am so proud of Bernie.

Our movement continues. Our revolution continues. We will never stop working for a future we believe in. We will never stop fighting for the change we need.

And we will never forget the man who has led us.

So with pride, gratitude, and optimism for the future we will all build together, I stand before you for the purposes of seconding the nomination of our friend and hero, Sen. Bernie Sanders.
