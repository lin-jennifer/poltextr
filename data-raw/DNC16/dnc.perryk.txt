Both my parents are pastors and staunch Republicans. I didn't finish high school. Unfortunately, I don't have a formal education. But I do have an open mind.  

And I have a voice.

I'm asking you to have an open mind.

And to use your voice.

Because on November 8th, you'll be just as powerful as any NRA lobbyist. You'll have as much say as any billionaire. Or you can cancel out your weird cousin's vote.

Here's how I'm going to use my voice: I'm going to vote for Hillary Clinton.

I love Hillary. I have saved messages on my phone from HRC. And you know I've got a closet full of Hillary-themed dresses.

I've been on the road with her since Iowa.

And now you can join her on the road, too.

If you go to HillaryClinton.com and donate before midnight, you could win a chance to join Hillary on the road and see for yourself why I know she should be the next President of the United States.

And maybe, I'll let you borrow one of my outfits.
