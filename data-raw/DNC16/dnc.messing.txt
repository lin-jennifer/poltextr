The horrific attacks on September 11, 2001 rocked my hometown and our country to their core. As a proud New Yorker, the agony of that morning and the heartbreak that followed will never fully fade. 

But neither will the sense of awe I felt after watching on television so many brave men and women pulling complete strangers from the flames and wreckage. Risking everything to protect us through hours and days of sheer terror.

Out of the chaos and haze on 9/11 emerged the face of the America we all know. Not divided, not spiteful, but full of strength and compassion. Courage and fierce unity.

Nothing could divide us on that day, and indeed, our shared humanity was all that mattered. Christian, Jewish, or Muslim; black, white, Asian, or Latino; gay, bi, trans, or straight. We are one people. 

And with strong, steady leaders in place, and the courage of everyday heroes to keep us safe, there is nothing we can't accomplish together. 

One of those heroes is with us today: NYPD Detective Joe Sweeney.
