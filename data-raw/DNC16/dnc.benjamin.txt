 I'm here tonight not as a mayor, a delegate, or even as a Democrat. I'm here as a father – a father with a promise to keep.

You see, a year ago, I got to introduce our oldest daughter, Bethany, to the next President of the United States, Hillary Clinton. And one of my proudest moments as a father was watching Bethie tell Hillary that she had her full support because, and I quote, "The guys have been president long enough, and now it's time for a woman to take control."

Hillary, in all her wisdom, told Bethie she was the smartest 10-year-old in the world. Who was I to disagree?

After that meeting, I wrote a letter to Bethany and my youngest daughter, Jordan Grace. I wrote, "You're used to hearing your dad say that as long as you work hard and have faith, nothing is impossible. But sometimes it can be hard to even dream of doing something nobody like you has ever done. Growing up, I never expected to see a politician who looked like me become president. I've always believed in my ability to do whatever I set my mind to. Grandma and Papa did a very good job of instilling that in me. But when President Obama took office, I felt like I really could do anything – truly, in a tangible way I could feel in my heart."

In that letter, I promised my girls that I would do everything in my power to elect Hillary Clinton because I want my daughters and your daughters and all of our children to know that feeling. I want them to grow up knowing – not just believing, knowing – that this is their country too and they can do anything, achieve anything, be anything they want, even President of the United States of America.

They're watching at home right now, my children and yours, watching as we come together to keep that promise because here, in the greatest country in the history of the world, nothing should stand in their way.

So go on to bed, girls. I think we've got it from here. Goodnight, Daddy loves you.
