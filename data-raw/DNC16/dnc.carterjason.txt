Greetings from the battleground state of Georgia.

When my grandfather accepted the Democratic nomination for president, he stood before this group and said: "It is time for America to move and to speak not with boasting and belligerence but with a quiet strength, to depend in world affairs not merely on the size of an arsenal but on the nobility of ideas, and to govern at home not by confusion and crisis but with grace and imagination and common sense."

Those words feel even more relevant today than they did 40 years ago. And I promise that he is itching to get on the campaign trail and elect Hillary Clinton.

This last year has been a remarkable one for our family. Almost exactly a year ago, my grandfather was diagnosed with cancer. He approached his diagnosis with the exact faith, dignity, and strength we've come to expect. He never stopped working for peace and health around the world, and he never stopped teaching Sunday school at home in Plains.

Today, thanks to the miracle of modern science and the power of prayer, I am happy to report that his cancer is gone. Not only that, but earlier this month, he and my grandmother celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary.

My grandparents demonstrate that there is a strength in love, humility, and service that no amount of anger, pride, or salesmanship can match. That principled strength sustains them in the work they do every day, and that same principled strength will elect Hillary Clinton as our next president.
