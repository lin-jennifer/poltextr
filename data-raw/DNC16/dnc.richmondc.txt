 My name is Cedric Richmond. I'm proud to represent Louisiana — "the Who Dat Nation" — in Congress!

I'm able to stand here today because my mother was a strong woman. After my father died, for a while she had to do the job of two parents. But she didn't do it alone. 

It required the help of school teachers, baseball coaches, our elders, and especially the church.

And it took a strong Democratic Party that invested in our communities — that invested in me. 

Through blood, sweat, and tears, our elders and our party created the environment for me to succeed. Because of that blood, that sweat, and those tears, I can sit, eat, and live wherever I want. I can vote without answering how many bubbles are in a bar of soap. And because of blood, sweat, and tears, the Obamas reside at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

As the poet Robert Frost wrote:

The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep.

We have made great strides under President Obama, but we still have miles to go.

When our kids have better access to guns and drugs than to textbooks and computers, we have miles to go before we sleep.

When women don't make the same wage as a man, we have miles to go before we sleep.

When we can't get Republicans to join us to enact sensible gun reform — even after Newtown and Sandy Hook and Dallas and Baton Rouge — we have miles to go before we sleep.

When the NRA has neutered the Republican Party, we have miles to go before we sleep.

We need Hillary Clinton because she doesn't sleep.

So this fall, when you are out there campaigning for Hillary, and you start to feel exhausted to the point that you just can't go on — do me a favor: Make just one more call or knock one more door.

Because we still have miles to go before we sleep.
