Hello, fellow Democrats! What a crowd! It's great to be here today. We have important work ahead of us. Work that will determine the future of our country. Are you ready? I'm ready.

I have a passion for helping people. I always have. So does Hillary Clinton. Hillary is tough. Hillary is courageous. She will fight to make our families safer. In the White House, she will stand up to the gun lobby. That's why I'm voting for Hillary!

I know what hate and division can do to our communities. Let's stand up for responsibility. Together we can make sure that respect, hard work, and progress win in November.

In Congress, I learned an important lesson: Strong women get things done! Let's work together to make Hillary our president. I'm with Her! And I know you are too.

Speaking is difficult for me. But come January, I want to say these two words: "Madam President."

Thank you very much.
