This November, I will be voting in my first general election. And I am excited that the very first vote I cast for President will be for Hillary Clinton!

I registered to vote at the DMV – on the same day I got my driver's license. It took just minutes, but I know it gave me power for a lifetime. The power to make my voice heard and to shape the future of our country.

I'm a Millennial – a member of the largest generation of Americans since the Baby Boom. But nearly four out of five young people stayed home in the 2014 Congressional election.

Imagine what can happen if we all make our voices heard at the ballot box this November.

We can elect a president who will fight to give every American a chance to graduate from college debt-free.

We can elect a president who will fight for equal pay for equal work. My amazing mother became a single parent when I was 13 years old. It wasn't easy. She had to balance a job and caring for her family. Imagine the difference equal pay could make for today's working moms and their families.

So listen: If you still haven't yet registered to vote, get registered right away. Check out www.iwillvote.com for more information about your state's deadlines and confirm you're registered. Don't miss this chance to make your voice count. Because if you show up, if we all show up this November 8th, we can put someone who will fight for us in the Oval Office. We can make Hillary Clinton the next President of the United States.
