Speaker 1:                                             Someone once said that America is great because it is good and that if America ceases to be good, it will no longer be great. It is the goodness in Americans that informs the greatness of America.

Speaker 2:                                             I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.

Speaker 1:                                             The freedom to do what is right and good, for yourself, for family. To reap the blessings of hard work, to accomplish dreams, to live securely, to help others, not by force of government, but by goodness of heart. Where rights are not granted by government or claimed by identities, but are unalienable as members of the human race. Today, America's greatness is challenged by those with extreme notions. Defunding law enforcement as lawlessness abounds. Hateful rhetoric, telling you what to wear and when you can work. Limiting free speech and freedom of worship. Old ideas of socialism repackaged in redefined words. Let us restore the values that made America great.

Donald Trump:                                          We will make America strong again.

Speaker 1:                                             Return to the higher standard.

Donald Trump:                                          We will make America proud again.

Speaker 1:                                             The land of freedom of speech, of worship.

Donald Trump:                                          We will make America safe again.

Speaker 1:                                             The land of security and prosperity.

Donald Trump:                                          And we will make America great again.

Speaker 1:                                             A land of greatness.

Speaker 3:                                             From Washington, D.C., welcome to the 2020 Republican National Convention. Tonight, celebrating America as the land of greatness.

Franklin Graham:                                       Let us pray. Our heavenly Father, which art in heaven, we thank you for the great bounty you have bestowed on this nation and the many blessings we have received these past four years. We are forever grateful. As we come tonight, our country is facing trouble. Tens of thousands are in the path of a deadly storm. The pandemic has gripped millions of hearts with fear. We are divided. We have witnessed injustice. Anger and despair have flowed into the streets. We need your help. We need to hear your voice at this crucial hour. We ask that you would unite our hearts to be one nation under God, for you are our only hope. We declare today our total dependence upon you and our need of repentance as a people. I thank you tonight for our president, Donald J. Trump.

Franklin Graham:                                       We pray that you would give him wisdom from on high, clarity of vision, and strength as he leads this nation forward. Bless him. We pray for our First Lady Melania, their son Barron, and all of the family. Protect them and keep them strong and safe. We thank you for Vice President Mike Pence, for his steady hand and clear voice. We pray for Second Lady Karen Pence and their family. Father, we know that you can make this nation great once again if we turn our eyes and our hearts to you and follow your word and obedience. May your will be done on this earth as it is in heaven, and we pray this in the mighty name of your son, my Lord and savior Jesus Christ. Amen.

Madelyn and Jac...:                                    I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all.

Kevin McCarthy:                                        As Americans, we carve our own destiny. As Americans, we look forward, not backward. Our ancestors braved the unknown. They built this nation, brick by brick. They lifted up millions from poverty, hunger, and disease. They vanquished fascism and communism. A great nation because of great people, and no one has done more to protect and advance it than President Trump. As Republicans, we are proud to stand with him and to work for you. Together we built the greatest economy the world has ever seen and we will do it again. We confronted China head-on, tore up bad trade deals and made better ones, supported our men and women in uniform, and took out the world's top terrorist. Achieved energy independence, defended the sanctity of life, and restored law and order at the border. But as every American knows, we face an invisible enemy that we didn't ask for nor invite, but we will defeat it. We will defeat it because America is where innovation happens and we are developing a vaccine in record time. We will defeat it because President Trump unleashed a Marshall Plan for Main Street and put hardworking taxpayers back on their feet. We will defeat it because tough times don't last. Tough Americans do and that is what this election is all about, you, not us.

Kevin McCarthy:                                        Joe Biden and Kamala Harris think this election is about the government. They're wrong. It's about your family and your future and to secure what really matters. We will call on the bedrock of what makes us the greatest country in the world, the American promise. A promise that everyone is equal under God, under the Constitution, and under the law. A promise that government is accountable to we the people, a promise that if you work hard and play by the rules, your opportunities are endless. As Republicans, it's our mission to renew the American dream, restore our way of life, and rebuild the greatest economy in the world. The socialist Democrats have a different agenda. They will dismantle our institutions, defund our police, and destroy our economy. So as you cast your vote this November, remember this. Four years ago, President Trump promised to be your voice. He kept that promise, but there's still so much more to do. The choice before you could not be clearer. Forward in freedom or backward in socialism. Forward in prosperity, or backward in poverty. Forward in personal liberty, or backwards in more government control. I know which direction I'm headed. Join us as the best is yet to come.

Ja'Ron Smith:                                          Hello. My name is Ja'Ron Smith. 20 years ago, I moved to Washington, D.C. to attend Howard University. I was at a crossroads, just like America is today. I grew up on Strandhill Road in Cleveland, a blue collar street in a blue collar city. When the media talks about forgotten places or working class people who are overlooked and struggling hard, there's usually some stock photo of people who don't look like me. They never seem to show people like my mom, who worked two jobs as a gas station clerk and a mom. She showed me how to persevere. They never seem to show people like my dad, who plowed snow in the winter and paved streets in the summer. Who stood by me through thick and thin and taught me strong values every day. They never seem to show people like me.

Ja'Ron Smith:                                          At first, I didn't live the values my parents taught me. I won a starting spot on the varsity football team but I only had a 1.9 GPA. But then I broke my leg. It took a broken leg for me to really get moving in life. I prioritized schoolwork, went to Howard, and ended up working for the President of the United States. Growing up, I never really known a Republican. I believed all the stereotypes. It took a meeting with Republicans who shared my values to show me I was wrong. Donald Trump knows that in the work of revitalizing communities, America's strength is Americas people and I can tell you, he really cares and he takes action.

Ja'Ron Smith:                                          Every issue important to black communities has been a priority for him. Prison reform, rebuilding broken families, bringing jobs back to America, jobs in Cleveland, jobs in Detroit, jobs in Milwaukee. President Trump knows that education is the great equalizer. That's why he secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities and is fighting hard for school choice. In the wake of the murder of Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd, and LeGend Taliferro, a moment of national racial consciousness. I have seen his true conscience. I just wish everyone could see the deep empathy he shows to families whose loved ones were killed in senseless violence.

Ja'Ron Smith:                                          President Trump has made it clear that if you want safe communities, you must have police departments with the highest standards. I will never forget Strandhill Road or the people of Cleveland. They're tough, smart, and tell it like it is. That's President Trump. For a New Yorker, he's got a lot of Cleveland heart, and I'm proud to say that he's my president. God bless America.

Speaker 4:                                             People assume that if I'm not a Democrat anymore that I must be a Republican or I must be conservative. I still consider myself a liberal but liberalism has changed and I don't fit there anymore.

Speaker 5:                                             As a black kid growing up in Texas, you were taught that you had to support Democrats because Republicans were for white people, supporting the rich, and we definitely weren't rich.

Speaker 6:                                             Basically our default setting is to be a Democrat.

Speaker 7:                                             I'm a Democrat, my parents are Democrats.

Speaker 7:                                             I was a huge Obama supporter.

Speaker 8:                                             In the 2016 primary I voted for Bernie Sanders.

Speaker 4:                                             I mean I was a socialist.

Speaker 7:                                             It wasn't until we got married and began expecting our own family that I began to kind of question whether or not the things that we were really promoting and supporting were in line with the way we were living and that was when the shift kind of began for us.

Speaker 8:                                             I was renting a room in this woman's apartment. She had three or four kids from three or four different fathers, she was my age. Most of them were incarcerated. I asked her what do you do, she goes I'm in the system. It feels like Democrats sort of get people hooked on this drug of free money where they basically say if you want your fix you have to keep voting for us.

Speaker 5:                                             Then this bold man comes down the escalator in New York City. I couldn't come out and say it right away, but deep down inside, I knew it was going to be the first Republican that I ever voted for.

Speaker 7:                                             His entire campaign was for all Americans. That was a turning point for me.

Speaker 4:                                             One of the hardest things to do is to challenge your own beliefs. Going straight to the source is really how I was able to overcome some of those pitfalls and so I want people to hear my story and know that you can actually go from being a Democratic socialist to a Trump supporter, but you have to look deeper.

Speaker 8:                                             I think there's a political realignment that's taking place. I've always been very anti-war and now Trump is by a mile the anti-war candidate. I've always been very much for free speech, Trump is now by a mile the more pro-free speech candidate.

Speaker 7:                                             What's at stake in November is pretty much everywhere you look, you either see prosperity and liberty and things that you want to preserve or if you're a Democrat everywhere you look you see something you want to tear down and remake in the image of some other country that's not as successful as we are.

Speaker 6:                                             I'm trying to conserve our values, our constitution, our God-given rights, the right to bear arms, freedom of speech. All the things that's always made this country great.

Speaker 4:                                             You know it took me a good long time to get here but I hope that Trump wins and that we can continue with the progress that he's made and the policies that he's put into place. Let's get our economy back on track and let's be moving in the right direction.

Jeff Van Drew:                                         Good evening. My name is Jeff Van Drew. I speak to you as a member of the Republican Party, but it always wasn't that way. How I became a Republican says a lot about today's Democratic Party. I'm from South Jersey, where we work hard, look after our neighbors, and care about our communities. Years ago, I was a local dentist and was asked by the Democrats to run for a town council seat. I had my doubts and I explained that my views were middle of the road to conservative, but the local leaders said the Democratic Party was a big tent and that they accepted people like me. I was elected to council as a Democrat, but as I won seats for county office, state legislature, and then Congress, I noticed things were changing. The Democratic Party had become less accepting of American tradition, less believing in American exceptionalism, less supportive of traditional faith and family. This was not the party that I knew.

Jeff Van Drew:                                         In 2018 after being elected to Congress as a Democrat, I was already uncomfortable with a San Francisco liberal running the House which is why my first vote in Congress was cast against Nancy Pelosi for speaker, but imagine how I felt after seeing members of The Squad quickly take control of the Democratic Party just weeks after being elected. The party had moved from liberal to radical. This new Democratic party wasn't just for higher taxes. Now they were for open borders, against our police, and against our God-given rights. When the radical Democrats went after President Trump with impeachment, they made another mistake. Democratic leaders told me that I had to vote for impeachment or my life would be made difficult and I wouldn't be allowed to run again. Listen, I'm from South Jersey, and you better come at me with more than just loud words and empty threats. I voted no on impeachment and it was an easy call.

Jeff Van Drew:                                         Soon after, I met with President Trump, and he made me feel more comfortable and welcome in the Oval Office than Nancy Pelosi ever made me feel in her caucus and a few days later, I officially changed parties and I became a Republican. Let me tell you about Joe Biden. When the Democrats tried to order me around, I was ready, willing and able to say I've had enough with their radical socialist agenda. Do you really believe Joe Biden is ready, willing and most of all able to do the same? As Joe says, "Come on man." Joe Biden is being told what to do by the radicals running my former party, the same radicals trying to install him as their puppet president. When I'm at my local diner, I tell people that America is the best nation in the world and that President Trump has helped make it that way. Republicans, Independents, and even Democrats, they all know that in President Trump's America, we have a strong military, strong support for our police, strong support for our veterans, and strong support for our seniors. In President Trump's America, we have a strong supply chain, good schools, we're energy independent and we protect our environment.

Jeff Van Drew:                                         There are a lot of Democrats who support our president and are disgusted for what their old party, what my old party, has become. Here's my advice. Be true to who you are now, not who the Democrats used to be. That's why I'm a proud Republican and why I will be voting for Donald Trump. Thank you, and may God bless you, God bless our president, and God bless the United States of America.

Michelle:                                              For me, the most important issue is jobs. We need to be able to pay our bills. I trust Donald Trump on jobs way more than I do Joe Biden. There is no doubt that Donald Trump has built the strongest economy we've ever seen and I know that he will do it again. Joe Biden doesn't have the energy and his ideas like raising taxes, it's going to hurt us. Electing Joe Biden as the president is a huge risk and I don't want the future of my son in the hands of Joe Biden. I want my son to be able to go out and get a good education. I want the economy to be strong. I want the country that he lives in to be safe and I want our borders to be secure and I don't want that in Joe Biden's hands. Donald Trump has built the strongest economy we've ever seen, he has made our country safe and as a mom, those are things that I'm very proud of and those are things that are very important to me when I'm looking for a president. I am sticking with Donald Trump.

Stacia Brightmo...:                                    My name is Stacia Brightmon. I am a single mother of two boys and I work in Houston, Texas for S&B Engineers and constructors as a warehouse receiving clerk. After serving my country in the Marine Corps, I worked various jobs, but I thought I needed a degree in order to have a career. I put myself into significant debt to earn my bachelor's degree in finance. Despite my degree in all of my efforts, at one point, my boys and I even found ourselves homeless. After being laid off yet again, I received an email from the Texas Workforce Commission about S&B's Women in Construction Earn While You Learn apprenticeship program. I thought I'd give it a try. I was a bit skeptical at first, but I said to myself, "Hey, if they're willing to take a chance on me, I should be willing to take a chance on myself."

Stacia Brightmo...:                                    At the start of the program, I was making $16.00 an hour while I trained to become a pipe fitter helper. Looking back, it wasn't easy, but boy was it worth it. I felt empowered that I was learning new skills and able to support my family again, I worked hard, got promoted, and even got a few raises. Later, I learned where President Donald Trump and Ivanka Trump were doing behind the scenes to make sure that people like me and you had a chance to rise up and succeed. President Trump started the National Council for the American Worker and the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board.

Stacia Brightmo...:                                    Together with Ivanka, he wrote policies that made it easier for states and companies to give opportunities to hardworking Americans like me. The president and Ivanka also partnered with the Ag Council to launch FindSomethingNew.org, helping to connect workers with training and apprentice programs where they live. If you find yourself in a situation like mine where you feel you have nowhere to turn, nothing to really fall back on, and you feel like no one believes in you, go online to FindSomethingNew.org and see that President Trump believes in you and more importantly please believe in yourself. Keep trying, keep pushing. Times will get hard, remember, just a few years ago, I was homeless and you know what now? I'm set to close on a brand new home at the end of the month, so my message to you is keep pushing. You can do it. Find the training program like the one I participated in and like me, you have an opportunity to build a career in life that you're proud of.

Stacia Brightmo...:                                    So with that being said, I'd like to talk to you about a different kind of training. This is the Trump campaign's national week of volunteer training. If you're like me, you know how important it is to put Americans back to work, so get trained and get involved with the campaign. Go online to www.trumpvictory.com and sign up and keep the president fighting for you for another four years. Thank you and God bless.

Dan Scavino:                                           My name is Dan Scavino. When I was 16 years old, I got a part-time job at a golf course just outside of New York City. One day, I was cleaning golf clubs when a man pulled into the parking lot. There wasn't a single person who didn't know who it was. Everyone's jaws were on the ground. It was Donald Trump. All I could think was nobody will ever believe this at school tomorrow. I never would have imagined it at this moment, but I've now been at President Trump's side for almost 30 years. All these years later, there's a part of me that still feels a sense of wonder every day when I consider the journey we have taken together and taken with so many of you watching tonight. Because my personal story with Donald Trump in so many ways is yours too. He saw potential in me, the spark. The possibility that I could be more, do more, and achieve more than even I thought was possible. That's how he views this country. We have also just scratched the surface of what we can do together.

Dan Scavino:                                           If there's one thing I hope you will hear from me tonight, it is this. President Trump is a kind and decent man. I wish you could be at his side with me to see his endless kindness to everyone he meets. The media can be a fog machine, creating a partisan mist around everything that's hard to see through, but in 2016, you navigated through it all. You found your way through the swamp and you arrived safely on the other side with Donald J. Trump as your new president. There are some things that were true then, reasons why you choose him as your country's leader that remain true today. You know the president cannot be bought. The American people must know their president isn't building his life, he's building yours. He knows the president cannot be bullied. President Trump is the first leader who's been too strong, too tough, and too savvy to be crushed by the status quo establishment and the political media class. You know the president cannot be beaten. He's got a fighting spirit like so many of you do, and winning for America is what he does. While they call it chaos, President Trump calls it change. Just think about what we achieved together with President Trump. The strongest economy in history, the lowest unemployment rate for almost all demographic groups, black Americans, Hispanic Americans, women, and so many more. He did that once, and he will do it again. You know it and I know it. We all just need somebody to believe in our capacity to do great things. Donald Trump believed in me when I was a teenage golf caddy and he was already one of the wealthiest, most famous people on the entire planet. He saw my potential even when I couldn't. He sees greatness in our country too and in each of you, he believes the world you dream about at night can be yours. He truly is a man of the people.

Dan Scavino:                                           Just think about what he has done with this convention. You've heard from real Americans with real stories. People who are just like us. People whose lives have been forever impacted by the president and his policies. You've heard from people like John Peterson, who has a factory in Ohio. Tanya Weinreis, who has a small business in Montana. Jason Joyce, a fisherman from Maine, and Cris Peterson, a dairy farmer from Wisconsin. You've seen a man who turned his life around, get a second chance with a presidential pardon. You've seen brand new Americans become our fellow citizens in a ceremony at the White House. You've felt the passion of pro-life and religious freedom advocates and listened to the heartfelt words of a man whose family fled communism and oppression. Who needs a non-stop parade of politicians when you got an army of the people behind you? On November 3, vote for the man who believes in America, and believes in you. Vote for my friend, your friend, our friend, Donald J. Trump. Thank you and God bless the United States of America.

Mitch McConnell:                                       Good evening. It's an honor to come before you tonight from the Commonwealth of Kentucky. As the only leader in Washington not from either New York or California, I consider it my responsibility to look out for middle America. This election is incredibly consequential for middle America. President Trump knows he inherited the first generation of Americans who couldn't promise their children a better life than their own. He's made it his mission of this administration to change that. I know because I work beside him every day. Today's Democrat party doesn't want to improve life for middle America. They prefer that all of us in flyover country keep quiet and let them decide how we should live our lives.

Mitch McConnell:                                       They want to tell you when you can go to work, when your kids can go to school. They want to tax your job out of existence and then send you a government check for unemployment. They want to tell you what kind of car you can drive, what sources of information are credible and even how many hamburgers you can eat. They want to defund the police and take away your Second Amendment rights. They want free healthcare for illegal immigrants yet they offer no protection at all for unborn Americans. They want to pack the Supreme Court with liberals intent on eroding our constitutional rights and they want to codify all this by making the swamp itself, Washington D.C., America's 51st state with two more liberal senators, we cannot undo the damage they've one.

Mitch McConnell:                                       Now you understand why Democrats spent an entire week telling us about who Joe Biden is, not what he intends to do. I'm immensely proud of the work the Republican Senate has done. We are the firewall against Nancy Pelosi's agenda. Like President Trump, we won't be bullied by a liberal media intent on destroying America's institutions. We will stand our post on behalf of the millions of Americans whose stories aren't told in today's newspapers, whose struggles are just as real. We will continue to support American families as we defeat the coronavirus and return our economy to the envy of the world. The stakes have never been higher, which is why I'm asking you to support Republican senate candidates across the country and re-elect my friend President Donald Trump.

Donald Trump:                                          So all of these titans of American sport know that many of life's most valuable lessons are learned on the field of competition and the ability to overcome adversity.

Donald Trump:                                          And your relentless will to win, win, win. These qualities embody the American spirit of pushing boundaries, defying limits.

Speaker 9:                                             It's a game cast in sports immortality.

Donald Trump:                                          And always striving for greatness. You stayed in the fight, you finished the fight, often bumpy roads lead to beautiful places. This great building is celebrating great people, and you're winners all.

Kevin McCarthy:                                        Would you please rise for the playing of our national anthem?

Donald Trump:                                          It's our honor to be in the company of great, great champions.

Speaker 10:                                            Team USA will indeed take home the gold.

Donald Trump:                                          We have to get our sports back. We can't wait to see what's next. Never give up, never lose faith, never, ever quit. Just keep forging ahead. Give everything you've got. Victory is always within reach.

Dana White:                                            Hey everyone. I am Dana White, the president of the UFC. Many of you know who I am, what I do, and that I am friends with the president. I spoke at this convention four years ago and I'm back because I believe we need President Trump's leadership now more than ever. Before the pandemic, President Trump built the greatest economy in our nation's history and created opportunities for all Americans like no one before him. Financial markets hit all-time highs, unemployment was at an all-time low and we weren't facing the lawless destruction that now is occurring in a few of our great cities. It blows my mind how quickly some of the leadership in this country has forgotten the critical role first responders play in our society. Police departments and other law enforcement, even some fire departments, have faced opposition from many in this country, but they are always the people who are asked to step up when things are at their worst and put themselves at risk. That has certainly been the case during this ongoing pandemic. Come on America, defunding these vital positions is not the answer. The first responders -

Dana White:                                            ... positions is not the answer. The first responders have always taken care of us and now more than ever, we need to take care of them. Now, let's talk about COVID and let's be very honest about it. No one person and no one place could have anticipated the challenges that COVID would bring. But, President Trump has faced all these obstacles head-on. He immediately put protective measures in place and he reached out to the best and the brightest leading American businesses, across all industries, to discuss what he and his administration could do to get the economy back up and running safely.

Dana White:                                            Let me give you more detail. In early April, President Trump organized a task force of business leaders across the country. I was fortunate enough to serve on that task force. Firsthand, I had the opportunity to witness how hardworking and determined President Trump was, to solve unprecedented problems our country was facing. I personally observed his ability to listen and understand the issues impacting Americans of all backgrounds. It was clear, his highest priority was always the health and safety of everyone in our country. Not just Republicans, not just supporters, but every single American.

Dana White:                                            President Trump recognized that one of the small ways to instill a sense of normalcy in people's lives, was to bring back entertainment options. The President went above and beyond to help all sports leagues involved, figure out a way to overcome the challenges of staging live professional sporting events in the middle of a pandemic. You know what? We did it. The UFC was the first to do it and we are continuing to do it.

Dana White:                                            Now, other sports have joined us and some of the lessons learned are being used to help reopen other types of businesses and schools. Make no mistake about it, we still have a long way to go. That is why we need a leader with President Trump's unique attributes at this critical time. I have said it before, and I will say it again. He is one of the most loyal human beings I have ever met. The man has unstoppable energy. No one, and I mean no one, is going to outwork this guy.

Dana White:                                            But, most importantly, he truly loves and believes in our country. He believes in the people of this country. America is a place, everyone wants a solid job. They want to take care of their family. They want to support the community, assist the less fortunate and enjoy the freedom this country has provided to all of us. While we have certainly experienced a ton of negativity in 2020, President Trump's mindset is to work tirelessly to find solutions to problems and help restore America. He did it once, and I'm telling you right now, he will do it again. Remember, President Trump may be the only president in modern times who has actually done everything he said he would do during his campaign. There's this quote that I love from Ronald Reagan, where he said, "There isn't any problem we can't solve, if government will give us the facts, tell us what needs to be done, then get out of the way and let us have at it." What that means to me, is as Americans, we work hard to overcome adversity and we face the tough times head-on. Irrespective of your gender, race, religion, or sexual orientation, what unites us as a nation, is freedom, equality, and opportunity. That's what it means to be an American.

Dana White:                                            Ladies and gentlemen, let's re-elect President Trump. Let's figure out what the problems are and continue to find solutions to those problems. Then, let's get to work. I'd like to close with this. While it's critically important to re-elect President Trump, this pandemic has also taught us to be very, very careful who you select as your next governor, senator, congressperson and mayor. It is so important to vote. Don't think that your vote doesn't matter, because to be honest with you, it has never mattered more than it does right now. Thank you and have a great evening, America.

Sean Reyes:                                            [foreign language 00: 04:34], and good evening. I'm Utah Attorney General, Sean Reyes. I'm a proud American and proud descendant of warrior ancestors, women and men alike, from my Hawaiian, Filipino, Japanese, and Spanish heritage. My father demonstrated his warrior spirit over 50 years ago, fighting a dictator in his homeland, the Philippines. Barely escaping with his life, he started anew in America. He arrived with nothing, but faith, determination, and a willingness to work hard. He lived the American dream, building businesses, a family, and seeing me become Utah's first minority statewide elected official.

Sean Reyes:                                            Today, I channel my warrior roots by battling human trafficking. I've been able to lead some of the largest trafficking prosecutions in America, and traveled to foreign countries, working with law enforcement and NGOs to dismantle trafficking networks and rescue people from the most brutal conditions imaginable. Young girls and women sold into sex slavery. Young boys and men forced into labor servitude. Illegal adoptions, organ harvesting, human life utterly debased.

Sean Reyes:                                            President Donald Trump is a fierce warrior against human trafficking. How do I know? Early in 2017, I had occasion to visit with him about our rescues. He asked insightful questions, expressed deep concern for victims. Overwhelmed with compassion, he promised to attack this evil. President Trump summoned Ivanka and leaders from his cabinet, directing resources and hundreds of millions of dollars for raising awareness, liberating victims, prosecuting predators, and empowering survivors. Together, they've done more to combat human trafficking than any administration in modern history. Now, that's a promise kept.

Sean Reyes:                                            President Trump's taken similar, aggressive action to break the chains of drug addiction and improve mental and behavioral health. He declared the opioid epidemic, a national public health emergency and made available billions of dollars to confront this threat. He also signed a bill, creating a phone number like 911, but for mental health. When activated, 988 will be a lifeline for those struggling with thoughts of suicide, depression, addiction, self-harm, or even hurting others. It will save countless American lives.

Sean Reyes:                                            A few months ago, my father, my warrior hero, lost his fight with cancer. When he passed, he had by his bedside, his scriptures, family photos, and a pen President Trump gave me to give him. Dad loved that pen. It represented freedom to him. The freedom that only exists when someone is willing to fight for it. To my father, President Trump is that ultimate warrior fighting for our freedom.

Sean Reyes:                                            If you listen to Democrats, the media and liberal elite, they will tell you that America's light doesn't shine as brightly around the world as it once did. That is simply not true. The same light that brought my father to America, inspires the desperate and downtrodden equally today. Believe me. I interact with some of the most marginalized victims on earth and they love America. They love President Trump, because he's fighting for their freedom and America's freedom. Thank you, President Trump. God bless you, and God bless America, this land of greatness.

Debbie Flood:                                          My name is Debbie Flood. I own a small foundry and machine shop in Wisconsin, that manufacturers cast bronze architectural hardware. My father, who was a World War II veteran, started the business with some used equipment and the American dream. Today, we are one of the only U.S. companies left, who make our products from start to finish under one roof. We really make things and we love it.

Debbie Flood:                                          When we lost nearly 50% of our business to China in the mid-2000s, we wondered how a small company like ours could continue to compete. At that time, Joe Biden was a Senator. He voted to normalize trade with China and help pave the way for them to join the WTO, even though they were hurting American companies like ours. But, we're tenacious and we're creative. We took a risk and purchased a 3D printer. 3D printing technology allows us to do things that China can't.

Debbie Flood:                                          Now, we can take a customer's idea from sketch to sample to production, in just a few weeks. This opened up new opportunities for us. Later, we fought our way through the great recession. Then, Donald Trump was elected and we breathed a sigh of relief. He actually fought for American workers and American craftsmen. He actually cared about bringing back those three beautiful words, Made In America.

Debbie Flood:                                          We no longer had to succeed despite government. Now, the government was on our side. We enjoyed a thriving economy stimulated by President Trump's pro-business and pro-worker policies. Thanks to the Trump tax cuts, I've been able to raise my employees' wages. So, they got a pay raise and a tax cut. Even in the face of the pandemic, the President doubled down on his support for business. Thanks to President Trump, our business was approved for the Paycheck Protection Program. That allowed us to keep our people working at a time when the future was very uncertain.

Debbie Flood:                                          Our President understands that the best solutions unleash the innovation of American entrepreneurs and the creativity of American workers. Joe Biden doesn't really know anything about business or creating jobs. He spent 47 years in government and it's doubtful that he'll finally figure it out in year 48. He's pledged to raise our taxes and bring back excessive regulation. I own a business whose mission it is to solve problems. Anything can be solved with a little creativity. It takes courage, commitment, and ideas. Those are all things that come naturally to President Trump, and that's why he has my support.

Judy Smith:                                            My name is Judy Smith.

Manuel Martinez:                                       My name is Manuel Martinez.

Claudia Perez:                                         My name is Claudia Perez.

Judy Smith:                                            I live in New York City public housing.

Manuel Martinez:                                       I'm the Resident Council President for South Jamaica Houses.

Claudia Perez:                                         I am Resident Council President of Washington Houses, which is in Spanish Harlem.

Carmen Quinones:                                       My name is Carmen Quinones. I'm the President of Douglas Houses, 3,500 strong residents here. I am a lifelong Democrat. I would really hate to get started on this mayor.

Claudia Perez:                                         Bill de Blasio and the way he has dealt with public housing residents is disgraceful.

Carmen Quinones:                                       This mayor has made our lives here, and I think every housing development, very uncomfortable.

Manuel Martinez:                                       Under the Trump administration, New York City Housing Authority has received an influx of cash that it has not seen since 1997.

Judy Smith:                                            I'm grateful for the spotlight that President Trump is putting on New York City public housing. I think it's wrong that the Democrats put illegal immigrants before Black Americans. How is it that we have people waiting on the waiting list for New York City public housing for 10 years or more, but yet we have legal immigrants living here? Something is wrong with that picture.

Manuel Martinez:                                       Since HUD came in with Lynne Patton as the regional director for HUD, it helped us identify some long systemic problems that we are now putting on the table and having discussions on.

Claudia Perez:                                         President Trump's administration have opened their ear and have listened. There's been improvement in public housing. We're very appreciative of this administration that has come and finally shine the light on what's going on and bringing real solutions to a real problem.

Ann Dorin:                                             Hello, my name is Ann Dorn. I'd like to introduce you to my husband, David, father of five, brother of 12, grandfather of 10, friend to thousands. He was the most kind, dedicated, loving life partner I could have hoped for. He had a big smile and a heart to match. He was blessed with the gift of gab and that gift enabled him to touch souls and inspire people, especially young people. Oh, how kids loved him and they really loved him back. Dave was all about service. He served 38 years in the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department, and six years as Chief of Police as the Moline Acres Police Department.

Ann Dorin:                                             After 44 years, he retired from law enforcement. But, he never retired from helping a friend in need. Since he befriended every person he met, he was a very busy man. One example of that, was his friendship with a young man named Lee. Dave had met him when Lee was just a kid, after members of his family were attacked and murdered. Dave took a special interest in the boy. They bonded and their friendship grew and remained strong throughout the years.

Ann Dorin:                                             Lee eventually opened a pawn shop. He trusted Dave implicitly and asked Dave to help with security. Dave had readily agreed. Whenever the shop's alarm would go off, the alarm company called Dave. He would investigate. If he got a call or if I went to bed, he would wake me up and tell me he was going to Lee's, just to make sure everything was all right. Most of the time, they were false alarms triggered by a storm or animals. But, I never rested easily until I heard Dave's key turn the door, knowing he was home safe.

Ann Dorin:                                             The alarm that went off the morning of June 2nd was for real. It was a violent night in St. Louis. Four officers were shot. Others were hit with rocks and fireworks. At least five businesses were damaged, looted or set on fire. As the Officer Wellness Coordinator and CIT coordinator with the police department, I was keenly aware of the rioting and spent the evening getting ready to mobilize support for officers who were impacted.

Ann Dorin:                                             After I'd gone to bed, David received a call from Lee's alarm company. The front door of the pawn shop had been breached. This time, he didn't wake me up to tell me. He probably knew I would have tried to stop him or insist on going with him. As I slept, looters were ransacking the shop. They shot and killed Dave in cold blood, and then livestreamed his execution and his last moments on earth. David's grandson was watching the video on Facebook in real time, not realizing he was watching his own grandfather dying on the sidewalk.

Ann Dorin:                                             I learned of all this around 4:00 AM. When our doorbell rang, the Chief of Police was standing outside. I wondered why Dave had not answered the door. It wasn't uncommon for him to be up watching TV at this time. I called out to him several times. There was no reply. He just wasn't there. I led in the chief and fighting back tears, he added the words every officer's spouse dreads.

Ann Dorin:                                             I relive that horror in my mind every single day. My hope is that having you relive it with me now, will help shake this country from this nightmare we're witnessing in our cities and bring about positive, peaceful change. How did we get to this point, where so many young people are callous and indifferent towards human life? This isn't a video game, where you can commit mayhem and then just hit reset and bring all the characters back to life.

Ann Dorin:                                             David is never, never coming back to me. He was murdered by people who didn't know and just didn't care. He would have done anything to help them. Violence and destruction are not legitimate forms of protest. They do not safeguard black lives. They only destroy them. President Trump understands this, has offered federal help to restore order in our communities. In a time when police departments are short on resources and manpower, we need that help. We should accept that help. We must heal before we can affect change. But, we cannot heal amid devastation and chaos. President Trump knows we need more Davids in our communities, not fewer. We need to come together in peace and remember that every life is precious.

Ja'Ron Smith:                                          Good evening. I'm Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon and a public servant. Before I begin, I'd like to say that our hearts go out to the Blake family and the other families who've been impacted by the tragic events in Kenosha. As Jacob's mother has urged the country, let's use our hearts, our love, and our intelligence to work together, to show the rest of the world how humans are supposed to treat each other. America is great when we behave greatly.

Ja'Ron Smith:                                          In order to succeed and change, we must first come together in love of our fellow citizens. History reminds us that necessary change comes through hope and love, not senseless and destructive violence. Abraham Lincoln once said to an America divided that, "Your purpose, then, plainly stated, is that you will destroy the government, unless you be allowed to construe and enforce the Constitution as you please, on all points in dispute between you and us. You will rule or ruin in all events."

Ja'Ron Smith:                                          These words of warning are relevant today. We have a choice. Do we want big government that controls our lives from cradle to grave? Or, do we believe in the power and wisdom of the people and their ability to self-govern, with help from a limited federal government? Our president, Donald J. Trump, believes in the people. He is one of us. He makes promises and he keeps them. He is transparent, and we certainly know what he's thinking. He does not submit to political correctness or towards enforces the media. He is real.

Ja'Ron Smith:                                          Right now, we need real. We need courage. We can't cower in a corner and hope that no one calls us a name, believing that will keep us safe. That is not courage, and that will not lead us to a good and just place. We must remember all those who sacrificed everything in order to give us freedom, and we must be willing to do the same for those who come after us.

Ja'Ron Smith:                                          President Trump does not dabble in identity politics. He wants everyone to succeed and believes in the adage, a rising tide lifts all boats. Many on the other side, love to incite division, by claiming that President Trump is a racist. They could not be more wrong. Years ago, Jesse Jackson gave Donald Trump an award for the economic opportunities he created for black people. In Palm beach, Florida, Donald Trump led the crusade to allow blacks and Jews into private clubs and resorts.

Ja'Ron Smith:                                          One of the first things he did as president, was bring the office of historically black colleges and universities into the White House, so that it could get proper attention and financial support. Before the pandemic, African-American unemployment was at an all time low. President Trump accomplished prison reform. He created incentives to encourage investors to become involved with economically deprived areas of America.

Ja'Ron Smith:                                          He strongly supports school choice, fully recognizing that no matter what circumstances a person is born into, they can achieve success with a good education. It was true for me. When my mother forced me to read books about doctors, entrepreneurs, inventors, and scientists, I began to recognize that the person who has the most to do with what happens to you in life, is you. My mother always told me, "Ben, you can do anything. But, I will never allow you to become a victim." It was then that I stopped listening to the people who were trying to convince me that I was a victim, and that others were responsible for my victimhood.

Ja'Ron Smith:                                          What is racist, is the fact that African-Americans have the highest abortion rate. President Trump is the most pro-life president in the country's history. He will continue to fight for those who cannot yet speak. The vision of a shining city upon a hill came from Jesus's Sermon on the Mount. America is that shiny city. We are the beacon of hope for the world. At this moment in time, President Donald Trump is the man with the courage, the vision, and the ability to keep it shining brightly.

Pat Lynch:                                             I'm Pat Lynch, President of the Police Benevolent Association, speaking to you on behalf of 50,000 active and retired New York City police officers. We are the proud men and women who wear a shield on our chest and put ourselves in harm's way to protect our city. We are proud to endorse our president, Donald J. Trump, for re-election because the stakes have never been higher. Like cops across the country, we are staring down the barrel of a public safety disaster. More than 1000 people have been shot in New York City so far this year. Almost 300 have been killed. These are not just numbers. These are real people.

Pat Lynch:                                             A father gunned down while holding his seven-year-old daughter's hands. A beloved neighborhood peacemaker killed by a stray bullet. A 17-year-old who made all the right choices, who worked hard to go to college and earned a sports scholarship, murdered before he can tell his mother the news. A one-year-old child shot dead in his stroller. Innocent people, innocent lives lost. One tragedy is too many, but every day the number keeps growing. Every day our communities are asking us, "Why is this happening?"

Pat Lynch:                                             The answer is simple. The Democrats have walked away from us. They have walked away from police officers and they've walked away from the innocent people we protect. Democratic politicians have surrendered our streets and our institutions. The loudest voices have taken control and our so-called leaders are scrambling to catch up with them. In city after city, they've slashed police budgets. They have hijacked and dismantled the criminal justice system. They've passed laws that made it impossible for police officers to do our job effectively.

Pat Lynch:                                             Here's the sad truth that every cop in this country knows. The violence and chaos we're seeing now, isn't a side effect. It isn't an unintended consequence. It's actually the goal. The radical left doesn't really want better policing. They don't really care about making the justice system fairer. What they want is no policing. What they want is a justice system that just stops working altogether.

Pat Lynch:                                             In places where Democrats are in power, the radical left is getting exactly what they want and our country is suffering for it. I've been a New York City police officer for 36 years. I've spent 21 of those years, protecting the cops who protect New Yorkers. I've never seen our streets go this bad so quickly. I've never heard from so many cops from every corner of the country who are saying the same thing, "Our hands are tied."

Pat Lynch:                                             If we're going to turn the tide and restore law and order, we cannot fall into the left's trap. There is nobody who hates bad cops, more than good cops. But, that doesn't matter to the radical left. To them, we're all just bad because we're all just blue. Their anti-law enforcement campaign isn't about a single incident. It isn't the result of one bad law or one bad policy. It's about a message. The message is, police officers are the enemy. The message is, criminals have the right to resist arrest. The message is, if you commit a crime, if you victimize the most vulnerable of people, the justice system will not hold you accountable.

Pat Lynch:                                             That's the message echoing through city halls and state houses across our country. It's playing on a loop in the media. The criminals have heard that message and they're taking full advantage. We must stop that message. We must expose the left's lies about police officers and the job that we do. We will do that because we have something that they don't. We have a real leader. We have a powerful voice in the most powerful office in our country. We have President Donald J. Trump.

Pat Lynch:                                             Unlike the Democrats who are running in fear of the mob in the street, President Trump has never apologized for supporting police officers and standing up for law and order. Unlike the Democrats who froze in the face of rioting and looting, President Trump matches his words with his actions. He gives law enforcement the support and the tools we need, to go out there and put a stop to it, period, in the story.

Pat Lynch:                                             It's never been harder to be a police officer in this country, but there are two things that keep us going. We look at the victims, the vulnerable, the regular working people who count on us. We keep strapping on our duty belts and bullet resistant vests because we know we can't let them down. While we do that, we hear the words of our president who says to police officers everywhere, "I will never let you down."

Pat Lynch:                                             We know that he hasn't, and we know that he won't. We've been fortunate to have him in office these past four years and we know that we cannot afford to lose him. When it comes to your safety, your family's safety, and the safety of all Americans, there's no other choice. You won't be safe in Joe Biden's America. We can have four more years of President Trump or you can have no safety, no justice, and no peace.

Rudy Giuliani:                                         Good evening. My name is Rudy Giuliani and I'm the former mayor of New York City. In 2013, my city elected a self-described progressive Democrat as mayor. New York City once described as America's crime capital, had become by the mid-1990s, America's safest large city. Now today, my city is in shock. Murders, shootings, and violent crime are increasing at percentages unheard of in the past. We're seeing the return of rioting and looting. During riots, this Democrat mayor, like others, has often prevented the police from making arrests. Even when arrests are made, liberal, progressive DAs release the rioters, so as not to disrupt the rioting.

Rudy Giuliani:                                         New Yorkers wonder, "How did we get overwhelmed by crime so quickly, and to climb so fast?" Don't let Democrats do to America, what they have done to New York. Again, the Democrats are urging you to vote for an obviously defective candidate. Biden has changed his principle so often, he no longer has any principles. He's a Trojan horse with Bernie, AOC, Pelosi, Black Lives Matter, and his party's entire left wing, just waiting to execute their pro-criminal, anti-police, socialist policies.

Rudy Giuliani:                                         The whole unprecedented wave of lawlessness began with a truly just cause, the unforgivable police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Peaceful protests began all over the land. The condemnation of the killing was universal, from President Trump to Democrat leaders. It seemed for a few brief shining moments, Democrat and Republican leaders would come together with a unified proposal to reduce police misconduct. This possibility was very dangerous to the left. They had a president to beat and a country to destroy.

Rudy Giuliani:                                         Although an agreement on action against police brutality would be very valuable for the country, it would also make President Trump appear to be an effective leader. They could have none of that. So, Black Lives Matter and Antifa sprang into action. In a flash, they hijacked the peaceful protests into vicious, brutal riots. Soon, protests turned into riots in many other American cities, almost all Democrat. Businesses were burned and crushed. People beaten, shot, and killed. Police officers routinely assaulted, badly beaten, and occasionally murdered. And, the police handcuffed by progressive Democrat mayors from doing anything, but observe the crimes and absorb the blows.

Rudy Giuliani:                                         But, the worst of it, was the slaughter of innocent young people with their whole lives ahead of them. The murder of four-year-old LeGend Taliferro in Kansas City shocked the nation, but not Black Lives Matter or there are many Democrats supporters. 17-year-old basketball star, Brandon Hendrix, was killed in The Bronx just days after graduating high school and on his way to St. John's to play basketball. He passed with only a brief mention. One-year-old Davell Gardner Jr. was shot and killed in a stroller at a cookout in Brooklyn and it caused no outrage.

Rudy Giuliani:                                         For President Trump and for us Republicans, all black lives matter. The lives of LeGend and Brandon and Davell matter to us. All lives matter to us. These continuous riots in Democratic cities gives you a good view of the future under Biden. All five of the top cities for homicides, like the top cities for rioting and looting, are governed by progressive Democrats. Using the progressive Democrat approach to crime, which is to do nothing substantive to reduce it, to release-

Rudy Giuliani:                                         Is to do nothing substantive to reduce it. To release prisoners as many, and as soon as possible, and to go to war with the police, the only group with the capability to protect your citizens. It is clear that a vote for Biden and the Democrats creates the risk that you will bring this lawlessness to your city, to your town, to your suburb. There is no question that this awesome job of restoring safety for our people cannot be done from your basement Joe. There's also no question that President Trump will fight with all his strengths to preserve the American system of government and our way of life.

Rudy Giuliani:                                         In critical times in our history, America has always been blessed with the right person to handle the crisis. Washington, Lincoln, Roosevelt, Reagan were perfect for the challenges they faced and brought our nation through gloriously. President Trump, with his boundless love of our country and all our people, his disciplined work ethic, his exceptional ability to inspire and his deep understanding of our system of government and the strength of American values is the man we can trust to preserve and even improve our way of life. Mr. President make our nation safe again.

Speaker 1:                                             A U.S. Attorney announced charges against Dr. Charles Lieber and two Chinese nationals today.

Tucker Carlson:                                        A systematic decision by many of our country's most powerful leaders to sell out America to China.

Joe Biden:                                             China is going to eat our lunch, come on man.

Speaker 12:                                            A 2013 trip to China, getting new attention this morning, not for what Joe Biden did, but for who he brought with him.

Tucker Carlson:                                        As a threat from China grew larger and more threatening, Biden seemed to grow more accommodated to the Chinese government.

Speaker 11:                                            Questions about money he made from foreign business dealings while his father was vice president.

Speaker 13:                                            And they knew they could get to Joe Biden's heart through his son, Hunter Biden.

Speaker 14:                                            They hoped to raise $1.5 billion. One person who did not want to talk about it, Joe Biden.

Tucker Carlson:                                        When it was already clear China had lied to the world in ways that hurt the world about a deadly outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus. Biden was still flacking for the Chinese government.

Joe Biden:                                             They're not bad folks, folks. But guess what? They're not competition for us.

Nancy Pelosi:                                          China would prefer Joe Biden.

Senator Tom Cot...:                                    Good evening. I'm Senator Tom Cotton. A lot's changed in four years back then we gathered in a rowdy arena. Tonight you're probably at home while I stand alone. Stands alone, that was the motto of my old army unit, the 506 infantry, the original band of brothers. From the Normandy beaches to the Iraqi desert, we fought alongside each other, but we were always prepared to stand alone. And so it is with our nation, we lead the free world, but we'll stand alone if we must, to defend America. Donald Trump understands this, he puts America first. That's why America is safer now than four years ago. But Joe Biden would return us to a weak and dangerous past. Barack Obama's own Secretary of Defense said Joe Biden has been wrong on nearly every major national security decision over the past four decades.

Senator Tom Cot...:                                    So let's compare the records of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Joe Biden slashed defense spending again and again. President Trump rebuilt our military, and added the space force. Joe Biden let ISIS terrorists rampage across the Middle East. President Trump eliminated ISIS's leader and destroyed its caliphate. Joe Biden opposed the mission to kill Osama bin Laden. President Trump avenge the murder of hundreds of Americans by killing Iran's terrorist mastermind, Qasim Solaimani. Joe Biden sent pallets of cash to the Ayatollahs. President Trump ripped up the dangerous Iran nuclear deal. Joe Biden treated Israel like a nuisance. President Trump moved our embassy to Jerusalem, and brokered peace deals in the Middle East. Joe Biden cuddled socialists dictators in Cuba and Venezuela. President Trump fights against communism in America's backyard and around the world.

Senator Tom Cot...:                                    And on the communist party of China, there is no comparison. Joe Biden aided and abetted China's rise for 50 years with terrible trade deals that closed our factories and laid off our workers. President Trump stands up the China's cheating and stealing and lying. Joe Biden allowed Chinese fentanyl to flood across our Southern border. President Trump sanctioned Chinese drug dealer for poisoning our kids. Joe said Chinese communist aren't even our competitor, aren't bad folks, just months before they unleashed this plague on the world. President Trump is clear eyed about the Chinese threat and he is making China pay. But China's not giving up, in fact, they're rooting for Joe Biden. America's other enemies won't give up either, but Joe Biden would be as wrong and weak over the next four years as he has been for the last 50.

Senator Tom Cot...:                                    We need a president who stands up for America, not one who takes a knee. A strong and proud America is a safe America, safe from our enemies and safe from war. No one who's seen the face of war desires to see it again. Too many of our fellow Americans or already honored at the hallowed grounds of Arlington. But if we want peace, we must be strong. Weakness is provocative. President Trump's strength has kept us out of war. Joe Biden won't stand up for America. Donald Trump will. So this November let's stand with the President and vote to keep America great.

Marcia Mueller:                                        My name is Marsha Mueller. This is my husband, Carl. Our daughter, Kayla, was taken as a hostage and murdered by ISIS. From a young age Kayla was amazing. She taught herself languages, how to write music, how to play guitar, she worked with troubled youth, military veterans, and native Americans. Everywhere Kayla went, people smiled. Kayla had a gift to be able to see the world through someone else's eyes. She became a humanitarian aid worker. And when she was helping children at an orphanage in India, Kayla wrote, "I find God in the suffering eyes reflected in mine. If this is how you are revealed to me, this is how I will forever seek you." She went to Turkey to help Syrian refugees in 2012. In August, 2013, she was asked by another aid worker to cross the border into Syria to help at a hospital. On August 4th, 2013, ISIS terrorist stopped her vehicle and took her captive.

Carl:                                                  Kayla was mostly held in a 12 by 12 cell in solitary confinement. It was cold and dirty, ISIS terrorist shine bright lights in her face. They shaved her head, they beat her and tortured her. The leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi raped her repeatedly. For 18 months she endured. And we endure an agonizing back and forth between us, the Obama administration and ISIS. We put all our faith in the government, but the government let us down. President Obama refused to meet with us until ISIS had already beheaded other Americans. To this day we never heard from Joe Biden. Instead the Obama administration hid behind policy so much that we felt hopeless when they kept us from negotiating to save Kayla's life. The administration showed more concern for the terrorists in Guantanamo than the American hostages in Syria.

Carl:                                                  The military prepared a rescue mission, but the White House delayed it. By the time it went forward Kayla had been moved to another location. After 18 months of brutal torture, we learned from ISIS that Kayla had been killed. The Obama administration kept telling us they were doing everything they could, but their version of everything wasn't enough. What a difference a President makes. Under president Trump, U.S. army special operators conducted a raid on al-Baghdadi's compound. After we learned that al-Baghdadi was killed, we learned something else, the operators named themselves Taskforce 814, after August 14th, Kayla's birthday. And the mission was named Operation Kayla Mueller. To those soldiers, thank you. Kayla was looking down on you.

Carl:                                                  The Trump team gave us empathy. We never received from the Obama administration. The Obama administration said it was doing everything it could. The Trump administration is. Let me just say this, Kayla should be here. If Donald Trump had been President, when Kayla was captured, she would be here today. When Kayla was a hostage, I'd go outside at night and look at the moon. I'd look at moon and I'd promise her I'd do everything I could to get her home. Now when I see the moon, I'm reminded of my promise to her I couldn't keep.

Marcia Mueller:                                        All Kayla wanted was to make it home. We are still working to find her and God willing we will bring her home. Kayla was born a miracle. We were told we would never have a second child, but God gave us Kayla. And she gave herself to the world. Eight months into Kayla's captivity. Another hostage was to smuggle out a letter Kayla had written. As we read it, we could see that God was holding her in his arms. In her words, she felt tenderly, cradled in freefall. She also wrote, "I have been shown in darkness light, and have learned that even in prison one can be free. I am grateful. I have had many hours to think how only in your absence have I finally at, 25 years old, come to realize your place in my life. None of us could have known it would be this long, but know I am also fighting from my side in the ways I am able, and I have a lot of fight left inside of me. I am not breaking down and I will not give in no matter how long it takes."

Marcia Mueller:                                        Kayla taught me so many things as her mom. She's still teaching us. Carl and I support Donald Trump because of his commitment to make and keep America great not with the power of the government, but with the passion of people like Kayla. Americans who even in the darkest days, always have more fight left inside of them. Americans who don't just talk, they act. That was our daughter. That's President Trump. As long as we stay strong like Kayla, as long as we refuse to break, we will be great. Thank you.

Alice Marie Joh...:                                    I'm free to hug my family. I'm free to start over. This is the greatest day of my life. My heart is just bursting with gratitude. I want to thank President Donald Trump.

President Donal...:                                    Almost all people said that Criminal Justice Reform would never pass. But we came together as a group, we worked across party lines and we got it done.

Alice Marie Joh...:                                    I'm an example of a woman who has been given a second chance in life. God bless you and God bless America. Good evening. I'm Alice Marie Johnson. I was once told that the only way I would ever be reunited with my family would be as a corpse. But by the grace of God and the compassion of President Donald John Trump, I stand before you tonight, and I assure you I'm not a ghost. I am alive. I am well. And most importantly, I am free. In 1996, I began serving time in prison. Life plus 25 years. I had never been in trouble. I was a first time non-violent offender. What I did was wrong. I made decisions that I regret.

Alice Marie Joh...:                                    Some say you do the crime, you do the time. However, that time should be fair and just. We've all made mistakes. None of us want to be defined forever based on our worst decision. While in prison, I became a playwright, a mentor, a certified hospice volunteer, an ordained minister, and received the special Olympics Event Coordinator of The Year Award for my work with disabled women, because the only thing worse than unjustly imprisoning my body is trying to imprison my mind. My transformation was described as extraordinary. Truth is there are thousands of people just like me who deserve the opportunity to come home. I never stopped fighting for my freedom. My Christian faith and the prayers of so many kept hope alive.

Alice Marie Joh...:                                    When President Trump heard about me, about the injustice of my story, he saw me as a person. He had compassion, and he acted. Free in bodied thanks to President Trump, but free in man, thanks to the Almighty God. I couldn't believe it. I always remembered that God knew my name even in my darkest hour, but I never thought a President would. When I was released on June six, 2018, I ran across that road and hugged my grandchildren for the first time. I'll never forget that feeling. And then I remembered the promise I had made to the men and women I left behind, that I would never stop fighting for them and I haven't. I'm using my voice to tell their stories. And I pray that my face reminds you of those forgotten faces.

Alice Marie Joh...:                                    Six months after President Trump granted me a second chance, he signed The First Step Act into law. It was real justice reform, and it brought joy hope and freedom to thousands of well deserving people. I hollered, "Hallelujah." My faith in justice and mercy was rewarded. Imagine getting to hug your loved ones again, and to think this first step meant so much to so many. I can't wait because we're just getting started. The nearly 22 years I spent in prison were not wasted. God had a purpose and a plan for my life. I was not delayed or denied. I was destined for such a time as this. I pray that you will not just hear this message, but that you will be inspired by my story, and your compassion will lead you to take action for those who are forgotten. This what our President Donald Trump did for me, and for that, I will be forever grateful. God bless you, God bless President Trump and God bless America. Thank you.

Speaker 15:                                            It's one of the great American success stories. A builder who left his mark on skylines around the world. A businessman with an extraordinary ability to communicate directly with the American people. A leader who grew tired of politicians leading our country down a road to ruin. He didn't do it for money or power or fame. He had all that. He did it because of his love for our great country.

President Donal...:                                    And we will make America great again.

Speaker 15:                                            Donald J. Trump beat the odds, smashed the establishment, and won the presidency for the American people.

Speaker 16:                                            Donald Trump has defeated Hillary Clinton to become President elect.

Speaker 17:                                            Hillary Clinton has called Donald Trump to concede the race.

Speaker 18:                                            It has been a stunning night, it has been a historic night.

Sean Hannity:                                          Washington D.C., the establishment is terrified. And they shouldn't be, they will all, all of them wrong, making this one of the greatest upsets in American political history.

Speaker 15:                                            Immediately upon taking office, President Trump changed things, but change threatened the establishment, and the establishment fought back. Democrat obstruction, phony investigations, the dishonest media, an incredible 92% of stories are negative. No president has seen anything like it. Despite everything they threw at him, President Trump delivered for the American people, and he delivered like never before. Building the strongest economy in American history, 7 million new jobs, the lowest ever unemployment for Black and Hispanic Americans ending the Biden era of lopsided trade deals that sent our factories overseas, passing the historic USMCA, taking on China, winning the trade war, protecting and strengthening Medicare and social security, lowering the cost of insulin, delivering the first real drop in drug prices in 50 years, restoring our military, fixing the VA, bringing our troops home and taking the world's deadliest terrorists off the battlefield Soleimani, al-Baghdadi, ISIS brought to justice.

Speaker 15:                                            Moving America's embassy to Jerusalem, a new era of strength and solidarity with our ally Israel, negotiating a historic peace deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, securing our border miles of new border wall being built illegal immigration dropped to the lowest point in a decade, tackling the Coronavirus head-on, fanning travel from China, mobilizing government, business and the American people to manufacture masks, ventilators and medical supplies, and launching Operation Warp Speed, an unprecedented effort to develop a vaccine to eradicate the Coronavirus from the face of the earth in record time. President Trump has accomplished more for the American people in four years than any other president in history. And in his second term, he will lead America to even greater heights, draining the swamp, rebuilding the economy, bringing back millions of jobs, creating 10 million new jobs in 10 months, new opportunities for all Americans, not just those at the top, lowering drug costs, expanding access to high quality healthcare for every American family, defending America's police, restoring law and order to our cities, stopping illegal immigration, and protecting American families, and ending America's reliance on China once and for all, bringing back jobs and factories, making medicine and products in America again.

Speaker 15:                                            President Trump will rebuild America's infrastructure, renew hope, and our entrepreneurial spirit for a new generation, and restore the American dream. It won't be easy, never pretty. The swamp will continue to fight him every step of the way. But under President Trump, our families will thrive, our incomes will rise, our communities will be kept safe, our factories will flourish, our flag will fly high, our country will soar, and we will make America great again.

Speaker 19:                                            Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Ivanka Trump.

Ivanka Trump:                                          Good evening. Before I begin, I want to send a special message to everyone who's been affected by Hurricane Laura. Our hearts are with you. The President will continue to support you every step of the way. And just like Americans always do, the nation will come together to help you rebuild your homes, businesses and communities stronger and more resilient than ever before. Four years ago, I introduced to you a builder, an entrepreneur, an outsider, and the people's nominee for President of the United States. Tonight, I stand before you, as the proud daughter of the people's President He is our Commander in Chief, champion of the American worker, defender of common sense and our voice for the forgotten men and women of this country, he is our President and my father, Donald J. Trump.

Ivanka Trump:                                          This evening, I want to tell you about the leader I know and the moments I wish every American could see. I want to tell you the story of a President who is fighting for you from Dawn to midnight, when the cameras have left, the microphones are off, and the decisions really count. When Jared and I moved with our three young children to Washington, we didn't exactly know what we were in for, but our kids, our kids loved it from the start. My son, Joseph promptly built grandpa a Lego replica of the White House. The president still displays it on the mantle in the oval office, right over there, so that he can show world leaders just so they know he has the greatest grandchildren on earth. I agree.

Ivanka Trump:                                          Over the last four years, we've learned a lot. I've seen in Washington, it's easy for politicians to survive if they silent convictions and skip the hard fights. I couldn't believe so many politicians actually prefer to complain about a problem rather than fix it. I was shocked to see people leave major challenges, unsolved, so they can blame the other side, campaign on the same issue in the next. But Donald Trump did not come to Washington to win praise from the Beltway Elites, Donald Trump came to Washington for one reason, and one reason alone, to make America great again. My father has strong convictions. He knows what he believes, and he says what he thinks. Whether you agree with him or not, you always know where he stands. I recognize that my dad's communication style is not to everyone's taste, and I know that his tweets can feel a bit unfiltered, but the results speak for themselves. He's so unapologetic about his beliefs that he has caused me and countless Americans to take a hard look at our own convictions and ask ourselves, "What do we stand for? What kind of America do we want to leave for our children?"

Ivanka Trump:                                          I am more certain than ever before we want a future where our kids can believe in American greatness, we want a society where every child can live in a safe community and go to a great school of their choice, we want a culture where differences of opinion and debate are encouraged, not canceled, where law enforcement is respected, where our country's rich diversity is celebrated, and where people of all backgrounds, races, genders, and creeds have the chance to achieve their God given potential. This is the future my father is working to build each and every day.

Ivanka Trump:                                          Building, after all, is what he's done his whole life. He's admired and befriended construction workers on countless job sites, but it has been a new and profound experience for him and for me to see these stoic machinists, this steelworkers, come to him with a tear in their eye and thank him for being the only person willing to go to the mat for them, for their jobs, for their families and for their futures. To the hardworking men and women across America, and here tonight, you are the reason my father fights with all of his heart and all of his might, you are the reason he ran for president in the first place, and you are the reason he is going to keep fighting for four more years.

Ivanka Trump:                                          I remember one evening in early February of 2018, we were in the oval office with my father's top economic advisors, and the president was pushing to keep the promise he made to renegotiate the bad trade deals that had gutted millions of middle class jobs. Most of his advisors argued that the economy was so strong following our historic tax and regulatory cuts, that it didn't make sense to risk rocking the boat. After the meeting, as I walked with my father back towards the residence, he said, "You know, the reason this has never been done before is because our leaders haven't had the guts. When the economy is good, they settle for good. And when things are bad, they don't have the will or ability. So they kick the kid until it's someone else's problem." He was right. If my father didn't take on these fights, no one would.

Ivanka Trump:                                          In the months that followed President Trump refused to settle for a good deal, he wanted a great deal, and ultimately that is exactly what we got. I remember each time he was updated on the progress of the new trade deal with Mexico and Canada, he would say, "Don't let down those dairy farmers I met in Wisconsin. I don't want them to like the deal. I want them to love it." Today in the midst of this unprecedented global pandemic, it's more clear than ever that our president was absolutely correct to take on trade when he did, and bring our jobs, our factories, and our lifesaving medicines, back to the USA.

Ivanka Trump:                                          As our nation endures this grave trial, I pray for the families who were mourning the loss of a loved one, for those who are battling COVID-19, and for the first responders and the healthcare heroes who remain on the frontline of this fight. The grief, sorrow, and anxiety during this time is felt by all. I've been with my father, and I've seen the pain in his eyes when he receives updates on the lives that have been stolen by this plague, I've witnessed him make some of the most difficult decisions of his life. I sat with him in the oval office, as he stopped travel to Europe. I watched him take the strongest, most inclusive economy in a lifetime, the lowest unemployment in a half century, and the highest wage increase for working families in decades, and closed it down to save American lives. It is why our President rapidly mobilize the full force of government and the private sector to produce ventilators within weeks, to build the most robust testing system in the world, and to develop safe and effective treatments, and very, very soon a vaccine. My father isn't deterred by the defeaters thinkers. The word impossible, well it only motivates him. Donald Trump rejects the cynical notion that this country's greatest achievements are behind us. He believes that nothing is beyond our reach, and that the best is yet to come.

Ivanka Trump:                                          I have seen all of my life, how my dad believes in the potential of each individual. Earlier this evening, we were all inspired by the incredible testimony of Alice Johnson, a great grandmother who was sentenced to life in prison for a first time nonviolent drug offense. I was with my father when he decided to commute Alice's life sentence. Together we watched Alice leave prison after nearly 22 years, as she ran into the arms of her family and they celebrated a joyful reunion, my father got very quiet, I could see the emotion on his face. After a long silence, he looked at me and said, "Imagine how many people there are just like Alice." From that point on, he became a voice for those who had been unfairly silenced in our prison system.

Ivanka Trump:                                          President Trump rectified the disparities of the 1994 Biden Crime Bill that disproportionately hurt African Americans. Against all odds, he brought together Republicans and Democrats, and passed the most significant criminal justice reform of our generation. And we're just getting started. My father did not campaign on this issue. He tackled this injustice because he has a deep compassion for those who have been treated unfairly. More than rhetoric and political pros, the ability to build consensus and achieve bipartisan success will help heal our country's racial inequities, and bring us forward together. President Trump is advancing.

Ivanka Trump:                                          President Trump is advancing the American values of work and family. Four years ago in Cleveland, I said president Trump would deliver for working women. Last year, over 70% of all new jobs were secured by women. Four years ago, I told you my father would focus on making childcare affordable and accessible. In president Trump's first term, we secured the largest ever increase for childcare funding, giving more than 800,000 low income families great childcare at a cost they can afford. As part of Republican tax cuts, in 2019 alone, our child tax credit put over $2,000 into the pockets of 40 million American families. Democrat politicians recently introduced a plan to increase the child tax credit. Yet when I was fighting less than three years ago at the president's direction to get Congress to double the child tax credit, not a single Democrat voted to pass the law. We got it done anyway. Four years ago, I promised that president Trump would support mothers in the workforce. In his first year in office, he signed into law the first ever national paid leave tax credit. Today, eight million more Americans have access to this benefit.

Ivanka Trump:                                          Four years ago, I said that Americans needed an economy that permits people to rise again. During president Trump's first three years in office, 72% of all new jobs went to Americans who had been outside of the workforce. Four years ago, I told you I would fight alongside my father, and four years later here I am. Many of the issues my father has championed are not historically Republican priorities, yet where Washington chooses sides, our president chooses common sense. Where politicians choose party, our president chooses people. Since the day he took the oath of office, I've watched my father take on the failed policies of the past and do what no leader has done before. Recently, he took dramatic action to cut the cost of prescription drugs, despite fielding angry calls from the CEOs of nearly every major pharmaceutical company. Now, when we see attack ads paid for by Big Pharma, my dad smiles and says to me, " You know we're doing something really right if they're hitting us so hard."

Ivanka Trump:                                          This spring, our president saw that American crops were going to waste because food supply chains were disrupted by the virus. He directed Secretary Perdue and me to find a way to get this nutritious food, fresh fruit, vegetables, meat and dairy to families most in need. Within a matter of days, we launched the Farmers to Family Food Box Program, which has now delivered over a hundred million meals into the hands of American families. To protect the most vulnerable among us, I've worked alongside the president as he signed into law nine pieces of legislation to combat the evil of human trafficking. I've stood by my father's side at Dover Air Force Base as he's received our fallen heroes, and each time it has steeled his resolve to finally stop, finally stop the endless foreign wars.

Ivanka Trump:                                          To change the paradigm in the Middle East, he took a fresh approach. I heard foreign leaders beg him not to move the American embassy to Jerusalem, yet he delivered on a promise, also made anD unfulfilled by past presidents because my father knew that it was the right thing to do. Defying all expectations, just weeks ago, he rewrote history again by making a peace agreement in the Middle East, the biggest breakthrough in a quarter century. For the first time in a long time, we have a president who has called out Washington's hypocrisy and they hate him for it. Dad, people attack you for being unconventional, but I love you for being real, and I respect you for being effective.

Ivanka Trump:                                          Our president refuses to surrender his beliefs to score point with the big political elite. To my father, you are the elite. You are the only people he cares about scoring points with. If these problems were easy to solve, previous presidents would have done so, but you don't achieve different results by doing things the same way. Washington has not changed Donald Trump. Donald Trump has changed Washington. America doesn't need another empty vessel who will do whatever the media and the fringe of his party demands. Now more than ever, America needs four more years of a warrior in the White House. Tonight, I could not be more proud to introduce my father, a man I know was made for this moment in history. My fellow Americans, our First Lady and the 45th president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. (Singing)

Donald Trump:                                          Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Friends, delegates, and distinguished guests, please, I stand before you tonight, honored by your support, proud of the extraordinary progress we have made together over the last four incredible years, and brimming with confidence in the bright future we will build for America over the next four years. We begin this evening. Our thoughts are with the wonderful people who have just come through the wrath of Hurricane Laura. We are working closely with state and local officials in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, sparing no effort to save lives. While the hurricane was fierce, one of the strongest to make landfall in 150 years, the casualties and damage were far less than thought possible only 24 hours ago. And this is due to the great work of FEMA, law enforcement, and the individual states. I will be going this weekend and congratulations, thank you for that great job out there, we really appreciate it.

Donald Trump:                                          We are one national family and we will always protect, love, and care for each other. Here tonight are the people who have made my journey possible and filled my life with so much joy. For her incredible service to our nation and its children, I want to thank our magnificent First Lady. I also want to thank my amazing daughter Ivanka for that introduction and to all of my children, Ivanka, please stand up. Thank you. And to all of my children and grandchildren, I love you more than words can express. I know my brother Robert is looking down on us right now from heaven. He was a great brother and was very proud of the job we are all doing. Thank you. We love you, Robert.

Donald Trump:                                          Let us also take a moment to show our profound appreciation for a man who has always fought by our side, and stood up for our values. A man of deep faith and steadfast conviction, our vice president, Mike Pence. And Mike is joined by his beloved wife, a teacher and military mom, Karen Pence. Thank you Karen.

Donald Trump:                                          My fellow Americans, tonight with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism, I profoundly accept this nomination for president of the United States. The Republican party, the party of Abraham Lincoln, goes forward united, determined, and ready to welcome millions of Democrats, Independents, and anyone who believes in the greatness of America and the righteous heart of the American people. In a new term as president, we will again build the greatest economy in history, quickly returning to full employment, soaring incomes, and record prosperity. We will defend America against all threats and protect America against all dangers. We will lead America into new frontiers of ambition and discovery, and we will reach for new heights of national achievement. We will rekindle new faith in our values, new pride in our history, and a new spirit of unity that can only be realized through love for our great country. Because we understand that America is not a land cloaked in darkness. America is the torch that enlightens the entire world.

Donald Trump:                                          Gathered here at our beautiful and majestic White House, known all over the world as the people's house, we cannot help but marvel at the miracle that is our great American story. This has been the home of larger than life figures like Teddy Roosevelt, and Andrew Jackson, who rallied Americans to bold visions of a bigger and brighter future. Within these walls lived tenacious generals like president Grant, and Eisenhower, who led our soldiers in the course of freedom. From these grounds, Thomas Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark on a daring expedition to cross a wild and uncharted continent. In the depths of a bloody civil war, president Abraham Lincoln looked out these very windows upon a half-completed Washington Monument and asked God in his Providence to save our nation. Two weeks after Pearl Harbor, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, welcomed Winston Churchill, and just inside, they set our people on a course to victory in the Second World War.

Donald Trump:                                          In recent months, our nation and the entire planet has been struck by a new and powerful invisible enemy. Like those brave Americans before us, we are meeting this challenge. We are delivering life-saving therapies and we'll produce a vaccine before the end of the year, or maybe even sooner.

Donald Trump:                                          We will defeat the virus, end the pandemic, and emerge stronger than ever before. What united generations past was an unshakeable confidence in America's destiny and an unbreakable faith in the American people. They knew that our country is blessed by God and has a special purpose in this world. It is that conviction that inspired the formation of our union, our westward expansion, the abolition of slavery, the passage of civil rights, the Space Program and the overthrow of fascism, tyranny, and communism. This towering American spirit has prevailed over every challenge and lifted us to the summit of human endeavor. And yet, despite all of our greatness as a nation, everything we have achieved is now in danger. This is the most important election in the history of our country. Thank you. At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas. This election will decide whether we save the American dream or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny. It will decide whether we rapidly create millions of high paying jobs or whether we crush our industries and send millions of these jobs overseas as has foolishly been done for many decades. Your vote will decide whether we protect law abiding Americans, or whether we give free reign to violent anarchists, and agitators, and criminals who threaten our citizens. And this election will decide whether we will defend the American way of life or whether we will allow a radical movement to dismantle and destroy it. It won't happen. At the Democrat National Convention, Joe Biden and his party repeatedly assailed America as a land of racial, economic, and social injustice. So tonight I ask you a simple question; how can the Democrat party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country?

Donald Trump:                                          In the left's backward view, they do not see America as the most free, just, and exceptional nation on earth. Instead they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins. Our opponents say that redemption for you can only come from giving power to them. This is a tired anthem spoken by every repressive movement throughout history. But in this country, we don't look to career politicians for salvation. In America, we don't turn to government to restore our souls. We put our faith in almighty God. Joe Biden is not a savior of America's soul, he is the destroyer of America's jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of American greatness. For 47 years, Joe Biden took the donations of blue collar workers, gave them hugs and even kisses, and told them he felt their pain. And then he flew back to Washington and voted to ship our jobs to China and many other distant lands. Joe Biden has spent his entire career outsourcing their dreams and the dreams of American workers, offshoring their jobs, opening their borders, and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars, wars that never ended. Four years ago I ran for president because could not watch this betrayal of our country any longer. I could not sit by as career politicians let other countries take advantage of us on trade, borders, foreign policy, and national defense. Our NATO partners, as an example, were very far behind in their defense payments, but at my strong urging, they agreed to pay $130 billion more a year, the first time in over 20 years that they upped their payments. And this $130 billion will ultimately go to $400 billion a year. And Secretary General Stoltenberg who heads NATO was amazed after watching for so many years, and said that president Trump did what no one else was able to do. Thank you. From the moment I left my former life behind, and it was a good life, I have done nothing but fight for you. I did what our political establishment never expected and could never forgive, breaking the Cardinal rule of Washington politics. I kept my promise. Together we have ended the rule of the failed political class and they are desperate to get their power back by any means necessary, you've seen that. They are angry at me because instead of putting them first, I very simply said, " America first."

Donald Trump:                                          Thank you. Days after taking office, we shocked the Washington establishment and withdrew from the last administration's job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. I then immediately approved the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, and did the unfair and very costly Paris Climate Accord, and secured for the first time, American energy independence. We passed record setting tax and regulation cuts at a rate nobody had ever seen before. Within three short years, we built the strongest economy in the history of the world. Washington insiders asked me not to stand up to China. They pleaded with me to let China continue stealing our jobs, ripping us off, and robbing our country blind. But I kept my word to the American people. We took the toughest, boldest, strongest, and hardest hitting action against China in American history by far.

Donald Trump:                                          They said that it would be impossible to terminate and replace NAFTA, but again, they were wrong. Earlier this year, I ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new US-Mexico- Canada Agreement into law. And right now auto companies and others are building their plants and factories in America, not firing their employees, and not deserting us for other countries.

Donald Trump:                                          In perhaps no area did the Washington special interests try harder to stop us than on my policy of pro-American immigration. But I refused to back down and today America's borders are more secure than ever before. Thank you. We ended catch and release, stopped asylum fraud, took down human traffickers who prey on women and children, and we have deported 20,000 gang members and 500,000 criminal aliens.

Donald Trump:                                          We have already built 300 miles of border wall, and we are adding 10 new miles every single week. The wall will soon be complete, and it is working beyond our wildest expectations. We are joined this evening by members of the Border Patrol Union representing our country's courageous border agents. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you. Brave, brave people. You see this country loves our law enforcement, they do, they do, they really do. Love and respect. When I learned that the Tennessee Valley Authority laid off hundreds of American workers and forced them to train their lower paid foreign replacements, I promptly removed the chairman of the board and now those talented American workers have been rehired and are back providing power to Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Virginia.

Donald Trump:                                          They have their old jobs back, and some are here with us this evening. Please stand. You went through a lot, please stand. Thank you. Thank you very much. You've been through a lot. Last month, I took on Big Pharma. You think that's easy? It's not. And signed orders that will massively lower the cost of your prescription drugs and give critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures. We passed the decade's long awaited right to try, right to try. We also passed VA Accountability and VA Choice. Our great veterans. We're taking care of veterans. 91% approval rating this month, the VA given by our veterans, first time anything like that's ever happened. By the end of my first term, we will have approved more than 300 federal judges, including two great new Supreme Court Justices. And to bring prosperity to our forgotten inner cities, we worked hard to pass historic criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones, and longterm funding of Historically Black Colleges and Universities. And before the China virus came in, produced the best unemployment numbers for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans ever recorded.

Donald Trump:                                          And I say very modestly that I have done more for the African American community than any president since Abraham Lincoln, our first Republican president. And I have done more in three years for the Black community than Joe Biden has done in 47 years.

Donald Trump:                                          And when I'm reelected, the best is yet to come. Thank you very much. When I took office, the Middle East was in total chaos. ISIS was rampaging, Iran was on the rise, and the war in Afghanistan had no end in sight. I withdrew from the terrible one-

Donald Trump:                                          I withdrew from the terrible, one-sided Iran nuclear deal. Unlike many presidents before me, I kept my promise, recognized Israel's true capital and moved our embassy to Jerusalem. But not only did we talk about it as a future site, we got it built. Rather than spending $1 billion on a new building as planned, we took an already owned existing building and a better location, real estate deal, right? Opened it at a cost of less than $500,000. Many things like that that government is doing right now. We also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and this month we achieved the first Middle East peace deal in 25 years. Thank you to UAE, thank you to Israel. In addition, we obliterated 100% of the ISIS caliphate and killed its founder and leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Then, in a separate operation, we eliminated the world's number one terrorist by far, Qasem Soleimani. Unlike previous administrations, I have kept America out of new wars and our troops are coming home. We have spent nearly $2. 5 trillion on completely rebuilding our military, which was very badly depleted when I took office, as you know. This includes three separate pay raises for our great warriors. We also launched the Space Force, the first new branch of the United States military since the Air Force was created almost 75 years ago.

Donald Trump:                                          We have spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. Biden's record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. He has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history. Biden voted for the NAFTA disaster, the single worst trade deal ever enacted. He supported China's entry into the world trade organization, one of the greatest economic disasters of all time. After those Biden calamities, the United States lost one in four manufacturing jobs. We laid off workers in Michigan, Ohio, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and many other States.

Donald Trump:                                          They didn't want to hear Biden's hollow words of empathy. They wanted their jobs back. As Vice President, he supported the transpacific partnership, which would have been a death sentence for the US auto industry. He backed the horrendous South Korea trade deal, which took many jobs from our country, and which I've reversed and made a great deal for our country. He repeatedly supported mass amnesty for illegal immigrants. He voted for the Iraq war. He opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed killing Soleimani. He oversaw the rise of ISIS and cheered the rise of China as a positive development for America and the world. Some positive development. That's why China supports Joe Biden and desperately wants him to win. I can tell you that upon very good information. China would own our country if Joe Biden got elected. Unlike Biden, I will hold them fully accountable for the tragedy that they caused all over the world, they caused. In recent months, our nation and the world has been hit by the once in a century pandemic that China allowed to spread around the globe. They could have stopped it, but they allowed it to come out. We are grateful to be joined tonight by several of our incredible nurses and first responders. Please stand and accept our profound thanks and gratitude. Many Americans, including me, have sadly lost friends and cherished loved ones to this horrible disease. As one nation, we mourn, we grieve, and we hold in our hearts forever the memories of all of those lives that have been so tragically taken, so unnecessary. In their honor, we will unite, in their memory we will overcome. When the China virus hit, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. Invoking the Defense Production Act, we produced the world's largest supply of ventilators, not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator, which is a miracle. Good job heading the task force by our great Vice President. Thank you very much, Mike, please, please stand up.

Donald Trump:                                          We shipped hundreds of millions of masks, gloves, and gowns to our frontline healthcare workers. To protect our nation's seniors, we rushed supplies, testing kits, and personnel to nursing homes. We gave everything you can possibly give, and we're still giving it because we're taking care of our senior citizens. The Army Corps of Engineers built field hospitals, and the Navy deployed our great hospital ships. We developed from scratch the largest and most advanced testing system anywhere in the world. America has tested more than every country in Europe put together, and more than every nation in the Western hemisphere combined. Think of that.

Donald Trump:                                          We have conducted 40 million more tests than the next closest nation, which is India. We developed a wide array of effective treatments, including a powerful antibody treatment known as convalescent plasma. You saw that on Sunday night when we announced it, that will save thousands and thousands of lives. Thanks to advances we have pioneered the fatality rate and you look at it and you look at the numbers, it has been reduced by 80% since April, 80%. The United States has among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country anywhere in the world. The European Union's case fatality rate is nearly three times higher than ours, but you don't hear that. They don't write about that. They don't want to write about that. They don't want you to know those things.

Donald Trump:                                          All together, the nations of Europe have experienced a 30% greater increase in excess mortality than the United States, think of that. We enacted the largest package of financial relief in American history. Thanks to our paycheck protection program, we have saved or supported more than 50 million American jobs. That's one of the reasons that we're advancing so rapidly with our economy. Great job. As a result, we have seen the smallest economic contraction of any major Western nation, and we are recovering at a much faster rate than anybody. Over the past three months, we have gained over nine million jobs, and that's a record in the history of our country. Unfortunately, from the beginning, our opponents have shown themselves capable of nothing but a partisan ability to criticize. When I took bold action to issue a travel ban on China, very early indeed, Joe Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. Then, I introduced a ban on Europe very early again. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died. Instead of following the science, Joe Biden wants to inflict a painful shutdown on the entire country. His shutdown would inflict unthinkable and lasting harm on our nations children's, families, and citizens of all backgrounds.

Donald Trump:                                          The cost of the Biden shutdown would be measured in increased drug overdoses, depression, alcohol addiction, suicides, heart attacks, economic devastation, job loss, and much more. Joe Biden's plan is not a solution to the virus, but rather it's a surrender to the virus. My administration has a very different approach. To save as many lives as possible, we are focusing on the science, the facts, and the data. We are aggressively sheltering those at highest risk, especially the elderly, while allowing lower risk Americans to safely return to work and to school. We want to see so many of those great States be opened by Democrats. We want them to be opened. They have to be opened. They have to get back to work.

Donald Trump:                                          They have to get back to work and they have to get back to school. Most importantly, we are marshaling America's scientific genius to produce a vaccine in record time. Under Operation Warp Speed, we have three different vaccines in the final stage of trials right now, years ahead of what has been achieved before, nobody thought it could ever be done this fast. Normally it would be years, and we did it in a matter of a few months. We're producing them in advance so that hundreds of millions of doses will be quickly available. We will have a safe and effective vaccine this year, and together we will crush the virus. At the Democrat convention, you barely heard a word about their agenda.

Donald Trump:                                          But that's not because they don't have one, it's because their agenda is the most extreme set of proposals ever put forward by a major party nominee. Joe Biden may claim he is an ally of the light, but when it comes to his agenda, Biden wants to keep us completely in the dark. He doesn't have a clue. He has pledged a $4 trillion tax site on almost all American families, which will totally collapse our rapidly improving economy. Once again, record stock markets that we have right now will also collapse. That means your 401ks, that means all of the stocks that you have. On the other hand, just as I did in my first term, I will cut taxes even further for hard working moms and dads.

Donald Trump:                                          I will not raise taxes, I will cut them and very substantially. We will also provide tax credits to bring jobs out of China back to America. We will impose tariffs on any company that leaves America to produce jobs overseas. We will make sure our companies and jobs stay in our country as I've already been doing for quite some time, if you've noticed. Joe Biden's agenda is made in China, my agenda is made in the USA. Biden has promised to abolish the production of American oil, coal, shale, and natural gas laying waste to the economies of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Colorado, and New Mexico. Destroying those States, absolutely destroying those States and others.

Donald Trump:                                          Millions of jobs will be lost, and energy prices will soar. These same policies led to crippling power outages in California just last week. Everybody saw that. Tremendous power outage. Nobody's seen anything like it, but we saw that last week in California. How can Joe Biden claim to be an ally of the light when his own party can't even keep the lights on? Joe Biden's campaign has even published a 110-page policy platform. You can't get away from this. Co-authored with far left Senator, crazy Bernie Sanders. The Biden-Bernie manifesto calls for suspending for removals of illegal aliens, implementing nationwide catch and release, and providing illegal aliens with free taxpayer funded lawyers. Everybody gets a lawyer come on over to our country. Everybody has a lawyer. We have a lawyer for you. That's what we need is more lawyers. Joe Biden recently raised his hand on the debate stage and promised to giveaway, he was going to give it away your healthcare dollars to illegal immigrants, which is going to bring massive number of immigrants into our country. Massive numbers will pour into our country in order to get all of the goodies that they want to give, education, healthcare, everything. He also supports deadly sanctuary cities that protect criminal aliens. He promised to end national security travel bans from jihadist nations, and he pledged to increase refugee admissions by 700%.

Donald Trump:                                          This is in the manifesto. The Biden plan would eliminate America's borders in the middle of a global pandemic, and he's even talking about taking the wall down. How about that? Biden also vowed to oppose school choice and close all charter schools, ripping away the ladder of opportunity for black and Hispanic children. In this second term, I will expand charter schools and provide school choice to every family in America. We will always treat our teachers with the tremendous respect that they deserve. Great people. Great, great people. Joe Biden claims he has empathy for the vulnerable, yet the party he leads supports the extreme late term abortion of defenseless babies right up until the moment of birth.

Donald Trump:                                          Democrat leaders talk about moral decency, but they have no problem with stopping a baby's beating heart in the ninth month of pregnancy. Democrat politicians refuse to protect innocent life, and then they lecture us about morality and saving America's soul. Tonight, we proudly declare that all children born and unborn have a God-given right to life. During the Democrat Convention, the words under God were removed from the Pledge of Allegiance. Not once, but twice. We will never do that. But the fact is, this is where they're coming from. Like it or not, this is where they're coming from. If the left gains power, they will demolish the suburbs, confiscate your guns, and appoint justices who will wipe away your Second Amendment and other constitutional freedoms. Biden is a Trojan horse for socialism. If Joe Biden doesn't have the strength to stand up to wild eyed Marxists like Bernie Sanders and his fellow radicals, and there are many, there were many, many, we see them all the times. It's incredible, actually. Then, how is he ever going to stand up for you? He's not. The most dangerous aspect of the Biden platform is the attack on public safety. The Biden-Bernie manifesto calls for abolishing cash bail, immediately releasing 400,000 criminals onto the streets and into your neighborhoods. When asked if he supports cutting police funding, Joe Biden replied, "Yes, absolutely." When Congresswoman Ilhan Omar called the Minneapolis Police Department a cancer that is rotten to the root, Biden wouldn't disavow her support and reject her endorsement.

Donald Trump:                                          He proudly displayed it. Shortly, later on his website, he displayed it in big letters. Make no mistake. If you give power to Joe Biden, the radical left will defund police departments all across America. They will pass Federal legislation to reduce law enforcement nationwide. They will make every city look like Democrat-run Portland, Oregon. No one will be safe in Biden's America. My administration will always stand with the men and women of law enforcement. Every day, police officers risk their lives to keep us safe, and every year, many sacrifice their lives in the line of duty. One of these incredible Americans was Detective Miosotis Familia.

Donald Trump:                                          She was part of a team of American heroes called the NYPD, or New York's Finest, who I was very, very proud to get their endorsement just the other day. Great people. Great, great people. If they were allowed to do their job, you'd have no crime in New York. Rudy Giuliani knows that better than anybody. Thank you, Rudy. Three years ago, in the 4th of July weekend, Detective Familia was on duty in her vehicle when she was ambushed just after midnight and murdered by a monster who hated her purely for wearing the badge. Detective Familia was a single mom. She recently asked for the night shifts so she could spend more time with her kids. Two years ago, I stood in front of the US Capitol alongside those beautiful children and held their grandmother's hand as they mourned their terrible loss. We honored Detective Familia's extraordinary life. It was extraordinary. Detective Familia's three children are with us this evening. Genesis, Peter, Delilah, we are so grateful to have you here tonight. Thank you very much for coming. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. I promise you that we will treasure your mom in our memories forever. We must remember that the overwhelming majority of police officers in this country, and that's the overwhelming majority, are noble, courageous, and honorable.

Donald Trump:                                          We have to give law enforcement, our police, back their power. They are afraid to act. They're afraid to lose their pension. They're afraid to lose their jobs, and by being afraid, they are not able to do the job that they so desperately want to do for you. Those who suffer most are the great people who they protect, and who they want to protect at an even higher level. When there is police misconduct, the justice system must hold wrongdoers fully and completely accountable, and it will. But when we can never have a situation where things are going on as they are today, we must never allow mob rule.

Donald Trump:                                          We can never allow mob rule. In the strongest possible terms, the Republican Party condemns the rioting, looting, arson, and violence we have seen in Democrat-run cities like Kenosha, Minneapolis, Portland, Chicago, and New York, and many others, Democrat- run. There is violence and danger in the streets of many Democrat-run cities throughout America. This problem could easily be fixed if they wanted to just call, we're ready to go in. We'll take care of your problem in a matter of hours, just call. We have to wait for the call. It's too bad we have to, but we have to wait for the call. We must always have law and order. All federal crimes are being investigated, prosecuted, and punished to the fullest extent of the law.

Donald Trump:                                          When the anarchists started ripping down our statues and monuments right outside, I signed an order immediately, 10 years in prison, and it was a miracle. It all stopped. No more statues. They said, "That's just too long." As they looked at the statue, "I think we'll rip it down." Then, they said, "10 years in prison, I think that's too long. Let's go home." During their convention, Joe Biden and his supporters remain completely silent about the rioters and criminals spreading mayhem in Democrat-run cities. They never even mentioned it during their entire convention. Never once mentioned. Now, they're starting to mention it because their poll numbers are going down like a rock in the water.

Donald Trump:                                          It's too late, Joe. In the face of left wing anarchy and mayhem in Minneapolis, Chicago, and other cities, Joe Biden's campaign did not condemn it. They donated to it. At least 13 members of Joe Biden's campaign staff donated to a fund to bail out vandals, arsenals, anarchists, looters, and rioters from jail. Here tonight is the grieving family of retired Police Captain David Dorn, a 38-year veteran of the St. Louis Police Department, a great man and a highly respected man by all. In June, Captain Dorn was shot and killed as he tried to protect a store from rioters and looters, or as the Democrats would call them, peaceful protestors.

Donald Trump:                                          They call them peaceful protestors. We're honored to be joined tonight by his wonderful wife Ann, and beloved family members Brian and [inaudible 02:47:27]. To each of you, we will never forget the heroic legacy of Captain David Dorn. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you. Thank you very much. Great man. Great man. As long as I am President, we will defend the absolute right of every American citizen to live in security, dignity, and peace. If the Democrat Party wants to stand with anarchists, agitators, rioters, looters, and flag burners, that is up to them. But I, as your President, will not be a part of it. The Republican Party will remain the voice of the patriotic heroes who keep America safe and salute the American flag.

Donald Trump:                                          Last year, over 1,000 African Americans were murdered as a result of violent crime in just four Democrat-run cities. The top 10 most dangerous cities in the country are run by Democrats, and have been for many decades. Thousands, more African Americans are victim, and victims of violent crime in these communities. Joe Biden and the left ignore these American victims, I never will. If the radical left takes power, they will apply their disastrous policies to every city, town, and suburb in America. Just imagine if the so-called peaceful demonstrators in the streets were in charge of every lever of power in the US Government. Just think of that. Liberal politicians claimed to be concerned about the strength of American institutions, but who exactly is attacking them?

Donald Trump:                                          Who is hiring the radical professors, judges, and prosecutors? Who is trying to abolish immigration enforcement and establish speech codes designed to muzzle descent? In every case, the attacks on American institutions are being waged by radical left. Always remember, they're coming after me because I am fighting for you. That's what's happening. It's been going on from before I even got elected. Remember this, they spied on my campaign and they got caught. Let's see now what happens. We must reclaim our independence from the left's repressive mandates. Americans are exhausted trying to keep up with the latest list of approved words and phrases, and the ever more restrictive political decrees. Many things have a different name now, and the rules are constantly changing. The goal of cancel culture is to make decent Americans live in fear of being fired, expelled, shamed, humiliated, and driven from society as we know it. The far left wants to coerce you into saying what you know to be false and scare you out of saying what you know to be true, very sad. But on November 3rd, you can send them a very thundering message they will never forget. Thank you. Thank you very much. Joe Biden is weak. He takes his marching orders from Liberal hypocrites who drive their cities into the ground while fleeing far from the scene of the wreckage.

Donald Trump:                                          These same Liberals want to eliminate school choice while they enroll their children in the finest private schools in the land. They want to open our borders while living in Waldorf compounds and communities in the best neighborhoods in the world. They want to defund the police while they have armed guards for themselves. This November, we must turn the page forever on this failed political class. The fact is, I'm here. What's the name of that building? But I'll say it differently, the fact is, we are here and they're not. To me, one of the most beautiful buildings anywhere in the world that is not a building, it's a home as far as I'm concerned.

Donald Trump:                                          It's not even a house, it's a home. It's a wonderful place with an incredible history, but it's all because of you. Together, we will write the next chapter of the great American story. Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing super power of the world. We will expand opportunity zones. Thank you, Tim Scott. Bring home our medical supply chains, and we will end our resilience for bad things. We will go right after China. We will not rely on them one bit. We're taking our business out of China. We are bringing it home. We want our business to come home. We will continue to reduce taxes and regulations at levels not seen before.

Donald Trump:                                          We will create 10 million jobs in the next 10 months, and it will be higher than that. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and surge federal prosecutors into high crime communities. We will ban deadly sanctuary cities and ensure that federal healthcare is protected for American citizens, not for illegal aliens. We will have strong borders. I've said for years, without borders, we don't have a country. We don't have a country.

Donald Trump:                                          ...borders, we don't have a country, don't have a country. Strike down terrorists who threaten our people, and keep America out of endless and costly foreign wars. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, justices who believe in enforcing the law, not enforcing their own political agenda, which is illegal. We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed. We will uphold your religious liberty and defend your 2nd Amendment right to keep and bear arms. And if we don't win, your 2nd Amendment doesn't have a chance, I can tell you that. I have totally protected it. We will protect Medicare and social security. We will always and very strongly protect patients with preexisting conditions, and that is a pledge from the entire Republican Party. Thank you, Kevin. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs and health insurance premiums, they're coming way down. We will greatly expand energy development, continuing to remain the number one in the world, and keep America energy independent. And for those of you that still drive a car, look how low your gasoline bill is, you haven't seen that in a long time. We will win the race to 5G, and build the world's best cyber and missile defense, already under construction. We will fully restore patriotic education to our schools, and always protect, we will always, always protect free speech on college campuses. And we put a very big penalty in. They do anything having to do with your free speech, colleges have to pay a tremendous, tremendous financial penalty. And again, it's amazing how open they've been lately. We will launch a new age of American ambition in space. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to plant its beautiful flag on Mars.

Donald Trump:                                          This is the unifying national agenda that will bring our country together. So tonight I say to all Americans, this is the most important election in the history of our country. There has never been such a difference between two parties, or two individuals in ideology, philosophy, or vision, than there is right now. Our opponents believe that America is a deprived nation. We want our sons and daughters to know the truth. America is the greatest and most exceptional nation in the history of the world. Our country wasn't built by cancel culture, speech codes and soul crushing conformity. We are not a nation of timid spirits. We are a nation of fierce, proud, and independent American Patriots. We're a nation of pilgrims, pioneers, adventurers, explorers, and trailblazers who refused to be tied down, held back, or in any way, reigned in. Americans have steel in their spines, grit in their souls, and fire in their hearts. There is no one like us on earth.

Donald Trump:                                          I want every child in America to know that you are part of the most exciting and incredible adventure in human history. No matter where your family comes from, no matter your background in America, anyone can rise. With hard work, devotion and drive, you can reach any goal and achieve every ambition. Our American ancestors sailed across the perilous ocean to build a new life on a new continent. They braved the freezing winters, crossed the raging rivers, scaled the Rocky peaks, trekked the dangerous forests, and worked from dawn till dusk. These pioneers didn't have money, they didn't have fame, but they had each other. They loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God. When opportunity beckoned, they picked up their Bibles, packed up their belongings, climbed into their covered wagons, and set out West for the next adventure.

Donald Trump:                                          Ranchers and miners, Cowboys and sheriffs, farmers and settlers, they pressed on past the Mississippi to stake a claim in the wild frontier. Legends were born. Wyatt Earp, Annie Oakley, Davy Crockett, and Buffalo Bill. Americans built their beautiful homesteads on the open range. Soon they had churches and communities, then towns. And with time, great centers of industry and commerce. That is who they were. Americans build their future, we don't tear down our past. We are the nation that won a revolution, toppled tyranny and fascism, and delivered millions into freedom. We laid down the railroads, built the great ships, raised up the sky scrapers, revolutionized industry, and sparked a new age of scientific discovery. We set the trends in art and music, radio and film, sport and literature. And we did it all with style and confidence and flair, because that is who we are. Whenever our way of life was threatened, our heroes answered the call from Yorktown to Gettysburg, from Normandy to Iwo Jima. American Patriots raised into cannon blasts, bullets and bayonets to rescue American liberty.

Donald Trump:                                          They had no fear, but America didn't stop there. We looked into the sky and kept pressing onward. We built a 6 million pound rocket and launched it thousands of miles into space. We did it so that two brave patriots could stay until and salute our wondrous American flag planted on the face of the moon. For America, nothing is impossible. Over the next four years, we will prove worthy of this magnificent legacy. We will reach stunning new heights, and we will show that the world, for America, there is a dream, and it is not beyond your reach. Together we are unstoppable, together we are unbeatable, because together, we are the proud citizens of the United States of America. And on November 3rd, we will make America safer. We will make America stronger. We will make America prouder. And we will make America greater than ever before. I am very, very proud to be the nominee of the Republican Party. I love you all. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you very much.
