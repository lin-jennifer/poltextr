Let me start by welcoming you to the 12th Congressional District of North Carolina and to Charlotte, the little country town that I was born and raised in and that grew up with me into the great city that has hosted you this week.

Growing up here, I learned some simple values: Help your neighbors. Respect your elders. Honor your commitments.

Today Barack Obama is carrying those exact same values forward as president of the United States.

This election is about standing up for those values. It's about fighting for what we believe in.

So let's get out there! Call your friends! Knock on doors! Let's re-elect Barack Obama!
