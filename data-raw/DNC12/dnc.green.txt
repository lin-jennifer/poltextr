America, it is up to us, right now, to make the decision on the type of country we will have. Either we move forward towards securing an economic future built to last with a strong middle class at its core, or we revert to a place where America's promise is only fulfilled for a select few.

In the 60's, we marched because it was the right thing for our country, and it made us stronger. Fortified by our faith, we helped our country overcome obstacles once thought to be insurmountableâ€”in our nation's laws, and our countrymen's hearts. Once again, this is our time to uphold justice. It's our time to protect the rights we've won, and it's our time to stand up for the country we love.

Our faith tells us we have a moral obligation to better our communities, to accept responsibility and care for each other. But these values are not just unique to believers, they are American values, and this is the American way.

America, it is up to us.
