I'm Kenyetta Jones. After I was laid off from the General Motors transmission assembly plant in 2009, I didn't sit around feeling sorry for myself. Instead, I started training people with basic skills, so when the jobs came back they would be ready.

Thanks to President Obama, those jobs did come back. He knows that America needs our jobs, because what happens to the auto industry happens to America. President Obama saved our community. He saved working America. He's my hero.

There are heroes all across America. Joining me on stage are some of those heroes whom the president met on his road to Charlotteâ€”people who displayed the quiet heroism we see so often in this country.

Ed Meagher is a Vietnam War veteran who, for nine years, has been placing a welcoming arm around soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. He has helped them to readjust to civilian life, prepare for jobs and simply come home again.

Lucas Beenkin is an Iraq War veteran so committed to his Iowa community that he ran for office from abroad and was elected as the only Democrat on the Wright County Board of Supervisors.

Rob Hach and his wife Tara are entrepreneurs who worked hard building their clean energy business in Alta, Iowa. After 10 years of hard work, that business now employs 27 people.

Martha Figeroa is a third-grade teacher at Joseph Gallagher School in Cleveland, Ohio. On her own time, she teaches English to students who come from more than a half dozen countries.

Ryan Case overcame personal tragedy and recommitted himself to his future by going back to school, thanks to President Obama's support of Pell Grants. Today, he's committed to expanding opportunity for other young people by encouraging them to re-elect President Obama.

These are the people who make our communities stronger, and make us all proud. Please join me in acknowledging these American heroes.
