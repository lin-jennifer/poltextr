We just heard from Bob King about President Obama's record of creating jobs. I want to tell you about Mitt Romney's record of cutting jobs. Mitt Romney once said—quote—"I like being able to fire people."

Well, I can tell you from personal experience, he does.

On July 5, 1994, Mitt Romney and his partners at Bain Capital fired me and more than 350 of my coworkers. It came without any warning. They rushed in security guards to walk us out of our plant. We weren't even allowed to take our personal items. They handed us job applications and told us, "If we want you, we'll let you know."

Now, the truth is, some folks were hired back—for lower wages, fewer benefits, and no retirement. But many others weren't. And seven months later, they closed our plant for good. What affected me most was having guys the age I am now come to my desk, and cry; guys who had nothing to fall back on.

I don't think Mitt Romney is a bad man. I don't fault him for the fact that some companies win and some companies lose. That's a fact of life.

What I fault him for is making money without a moral compass. I fault him for putting profits before working people like me. But that's just Romney economics.

America cannot afford Romney economics. Mitt Romney will stick it to working people. Barack Obama is sticking up for working people. It's as simple as that.

That's why I'm supporting him for a second term as president.
