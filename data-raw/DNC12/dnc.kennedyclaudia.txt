I am proud to be here, proud to be an American and proud to be a Democrat. The speeches are great, but the most important thing we can do is create policy that improves the lives of everyday Americans. Sometimes that gets lost in the rhetoric and commentary. But the fact is, Democratic Party policies are tough and smart and have improved lives all over the country.

Look, I know something about what it takes to keep this country safe, and I watched this president as he helped make America stronger. President Obama has brought our troops home and taken care of them upon their return. He has taken the fight to our enemies and restored our alliances and standing in the world. He has ended "don't ask, don't tell."

If President Obama is re-elected, America will continue to move forward. And now we have a chance to meet some of the people whose lives are better thanks to President Obama and to hear their stories.
