My name is Johanny Adames, and I am excited to be here, but not nearly as excited as my mom, Alva. "Gracias por todo, Mama!"

My mom taught me to work hard. Today, I'm a student at Miami Dade College, working hard toward my degree. This could only happen in America. But it only happened for me because of a Pell grant. President Obama knows that education is how kids like me can follow a path of opportunity and work their way into the middle class. And he fought to expand Pell grants so nearly 10 million young Americans can have that opportunity. Even better, he doubled the size of Pell grants so that someone like me can pay for tuition and afford books, too. When you're trying to pay for college, every dollar makes a difference. And President Obama has made a huge difference for us.

Everybody says that young people like me are America's future. But Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan want to cut the Pell grants that make my future possible. If they won't invest in my future, do they really believe in America's?

I was proud to get my U.S. citizenship this year. And on November 6th, I'll be proud to cast my first vote. I want a president who believes in me, and my mom's not running this year. But President Obama believes in every kid, no matter who they are or where they come from. He doesn't just believe in my future, he's building America's future. And I can't wait to vote for him.
