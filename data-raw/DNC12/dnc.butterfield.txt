We all know the road to recovery hasn't been easy. Republicans have thrown up every roadblock conceivable.

So this fall, we need to send them a message: Stop playing games with our future.

When we re-elect President Obama, it won't just be a victory for Democrats but a victory for the entire middle class. Because we'll put a jobs bill on the table—and pass it. We'll demand a balanced approach to deficit reduction that requires millionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share of taxes and do their part.

The choice couldn't be clearer. Go home, roll up your sleeves, register voters, and make sure that every vote in your community is cast for our Democratic team.

Let's keep North Carolina blue—and President Obama in the White House!
