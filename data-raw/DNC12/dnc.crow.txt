I'm not a delegate. I'm not a politician. I'm a veteran.

I was an Army Ranger captain and fought alongside some of this country's bravest soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. And like all veterans, I swore an oath and promised to defend our country. And our country made a promise too, a promise to support us overseas and fight for us when we came home. I'm here to say that President Obama kept that promise.

I now live with my wife and son in Colorado, but many of the men and women with whom I served never returned home. And others came home bearing visible and invisible scars of battle. When they and their families needed help, our commander-in-chief was there for them, from expanding veterans' benefits to strengthening the VA health system.

President Obama knows that the military is the standard-bearer for American values. It was wrong that men and women I served with could be told they weren't good enough just because of their sexual orientation. Soldiers who I trusted with my life, and fought alongside with, could be discharged because of who they loved.

President Obama did the right thing by ending "don't ask, don't tell." The choice is clear.

In the biggest speech of his life, Governor Romney didn't mention our troops in Afghanistan even once. President Obama is thinking about service members, their families and veterans every single day.

All our service members and veterans deserve four more years of a president who has their back. And that is why, right now, I am asking you to join me in supporting our president, our commander-in-chief, Barack Obama.
