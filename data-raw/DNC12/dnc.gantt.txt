Good evening, fellow Democrats!

Since we were together in 2008, we have lost some of our leaders and our friends.

First, one of Charlotte's own, Susan Burgess. Susan spent three decades in community and public service, on the school board and the city council. She served on the Democratic National Committee and helped lead Charlotte's effort to bring this convention here tonight.

She fought for what she believed in, and she fought her own battle with cancer. Sadly, she did not get the chance to see this convention convene. But I know she'd be very proud, and she is with us in spirit.

This brief film will highlight many other leaders who have passed in the last four years. Their work and their ideals inspire us every day. Tonight, we salute their contributions.
