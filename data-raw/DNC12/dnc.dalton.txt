Welcome to North Carolinaâ€”a state that went blue in 2008, and a state that will go blue again in 2012!

This election is a choice between two directions: forward and back. That's the choice before this country and this state, where I'm proud to be our party's nominee for governor.

My father, who served in our state's Senate, taught me that the right policies can lift lives. He died when I was eight. He believed, as I believe, that we must fight for the middle class. That education creates opportunity. Those are my values. And you know they're President Obama's values, too.

So if you share these values, go to daltonfornc.com. Get involved. Vote for Walter Dalton and our president. And together we will move this country forward.
