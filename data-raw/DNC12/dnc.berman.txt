I'm so proud to be at the Democratic National Convention from Florida. I'm one of the seniors who retired to this piece of heaven on earth and I'm as happy as a clam. It's not just the sunshine; it's Obamacare. I'm getting preventive care for free and my prescription drugs for less. It's pretty great.

But the Romney-Ryan plan has me terrified, not just for me but for my three daughters who are in their fifties.

If Mitt Romney gets into office, the Medicare that they've earned will turn into voucher-care. Seniors will get a voucher to purchase health insurance, but the voucher won't keep up with the costs, which could push people into private insurance plans. And even though many seniors are on fixed incomes, it could add up to $6,400 more a year in out-of-pocket costs. And on top of that, he's threatened to repeal Obamacare on day one.

Thousands of dollars might be pocket change to Mitt Romney, but that's a lot of money in my family. It's birthday presents for my grandkids and a flight to visit them. Republicans are trying to end Medicare as we know it. But we are not going to let them. We have worked for our Medicare, we have paid for our Medicare and we have earned our Medicare.

I'm proud to have been born the same year that Social Security was. It was the most important law of my lifetime. Medicare was pretty great too. And now we have Obamacare, which preserves the promise of Medicare and a secure retirement. So like I tell my daughters, let's vote like our lives depend on itâ€”because they do!
