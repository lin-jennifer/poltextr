I'm so proud to represent the millions of volunteers who make up the best grassroots organization in the history of American politics! Let's hear it for our neighborhood team leaders, the heart and soul of our grassroots army!

Every morning, the first thing I read are the numbers from the day before. Not poll numbers or money. The numbers that mean something: door-knocks, conversations, registered voters.

Our volunteers have made 44 million calls and knocked on 3.8 million doors. We've registered more than a million voters—already more than in 2008. And no state has registered more people than the great, blue state of North Carolina!

We're doing exactly what the Republicans don't want: getting more people involved in our democracy. Giving more Americans a voice in their future.

Here's how the greatest grassroots organization in the history of political campaigns is going to do just that: First, register right now. Go to gottaregister.com—that's gottaregister.com. Second, if you're already registered, go to commit.barack obama.com. We need each and every one of you to commit to vote for Barack Obama today! Third, take out your phones. For the first time in history, you can donate by texting. Just text "give" to 622-62 to donate $10 right now. That's 622-62.

Voting in Iowa starts in just over three weeks from today. There's no time to lose. If you want to protect health reform, hit some doors. If you want a clean energy future where new jobs are more important than giveaways to oil companies, make some phone calls. If you think our kids should have more teachers and millionaires should have fewer tax breaks, spread the word online.

This election isn't about Barack Obama or Mitt Romney. It's about you. The other guys write $10 million checks and make $10,000 bets. But we've bet this campaign on you.

I'd make that bet every day, and twice on Tuesday. Especially when that Tuesday is Election Day.
